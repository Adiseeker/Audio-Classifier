What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
I checked a few forecasts from the year before, which were set for 2022, and few of them turned out to be prophetic.
Well, even the inflation forecast. Even the president of the National Bank of Poland was wrong.
I think it's quite typical. Why else?
Because he's an expert.
Yes, some people say that, but I say that there is a lot of pressure on most of the experts I know from most of the areas I have contact with.
Even financial influence cases are documented on the position, opinion or decision of experts.
And I don't think it should be a shock to anyone.
Before we get to the topic, it's time to introduce our guest, and he is and will be our weekly guest, Mariusz Stefaniak.
A man who connects many fields, both as a practitioner and as a theorist.
Economist, financialist, manager, among other large IT companies, marketing specialist, and most of all, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Let's pay attention to the name - ""Więcej Mądrości"".
Every week we will meet regularly and talk about the economy and the complexity of the world.
Good morning, Mr. Mariusz.
Hello, I bow.
Let's get back to the topic.
An example of a wrong forecast is the housing market.
It was supposed to develop, prices were supposed to rise, demand was supposed to rise, and suddenly it turns out that not so much.
Yes, this is a beautiful example.
Why were these forecasts so optimistic in this case?
Optimistic? There is only one answer, because you earn money on it.
Please note that the real estate market is one of the most profitable markets in the world.
Developers earn money, landowners earn money, good business.
Governments earn money, sir.
This is probably the most important, great example, for example, such an extreme, but the largest in the world, are China.
One day we can talk about it in detail, I will show the whole mechanism, a shocking mechanism, I assume for the majority.
For me, a completely standard thing in this industry.
I am saving topic number one for the next edition.
But we also have the cryptocurrency market, which has grown incredibly and it seemed that it would also grow all the time.
Yes, the forecasts were amazing.
I remember forecasts that said that in 2022 Bitcoin would cost 120, 140, 150 thousand dollars.
Well, how much it costs today, it's easy to see.
The mechanism itself, ladies and gentlemen, and it's easy to notice a certain scheme, because you earn great money on it.
On recording something that we can safely call speculative banks.
But someone goes, someone else buys, agrees, accepts prices.
So what, we have on the one hand, the players, and on the other hand, the sheep that go where they are told?
Exactly, you know it well.
This is how you can emphasize all events in the history of the world.
Sheep go to slaughter, and the shepherd benefits from it.
But let's go back to the topic of experts who predict and not always or rarely do they come across these predictions.
Do we have bad experts or do we have experts who work for someone else's order, not necessarily those who listen to them?
We definitely have good experts in the world and they are brilliant people, great specialists.
But a completely strange coincidence is not the people who are most liked and promoted by the government, the media or large corporations.
They can't get through with their message to the mass media, to public information.
Yes, because this message warns the sheep that they are going to slaughter.
Well, the shepherd can't like such a message, please forgive me, no shepherd will agree to someone who will warn the sheep before entering the slaughterhouse.
Well, because they will rebel.
Well, or they will go the other way, because it will suddenly turn out that the shepherd cannot handle hundreds of thousands of sheep at once.
Unless the sheep will follow the sheep that leads them.
Mr. Marysia, but maybe we live in very unpredictable times, maybe the war and the attack of Russia on Ukraine could not have been predicted.
Well, the facts speak differently, sir.
The facts that have been documented beyond any doubt are that at least 7 months earlier, the largest governments had 100% certain data on the attack.
What will it be, how will it be, where will it be? These are the facts. It has even been published.
It did not get to the public opinion.
It did, you just have to know where to read.
At this point, we will take a short break, we will be back after a moment of music.

What is being played, Mr. Mariusz? We are coming back to the antenna. Our guest is an economist, a financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Mr. Mariusz, one of the examples of events, actually global events, which dominated the world public opinion for a very long time and suddenly stopped, is the COVID pandemic.
Two years ago, it was number one in all the news, everyone was afraid of the pandemic. Suddenly, we stopped being afraid of it.
Is COVID still a real threat or was it a real threat to us?
It was undoubtedly, but not as people believed.
I mean, how?
I mean, COVID was and is a deadly threat, but economically, financially, socially, this is its main force, crushing, deadly force.
But the virus attacks humans, it does not attack the economy.
You are right, but from what I know, we absorb a gigantic amount of viruses every day and somehow we live. And you have known this for thousands, thousands, thousands of years.
And if you checked the scientific facts, what I did at the beginning of the pandemic, because I didn't know either, of course, I'm not an omnibus, so I learned.
And what I saw solved most of the questions for the next two years.
But I can also present exactly what I did, how I did it and to what extent I came to.
Because it's slowly coming out and it's coming out on a gigantic scale.
And it will be coming out for at least another year, that's for sure.
So let him tell you a little more.
For example, I will give you simple facts that are published again, so I will be able to verify what I say very quickly.
For example, in a mysterious way, contracts with the largest companies that have received vaccines around the world have disappeared.
And officials from the European Union are not able to present contracts on the basis of which they bought and introduced vaccines to the circulation.
And they even forced people to take it, at least they persuaded, and at some points they forced.
And now they are not able to show these documents on the basis of which they did it.
And in other countries similar things are happening.
And please believe me that this is only going to get deeper.
In addition, there were also evident financial links between the most important officials who were responsible for implementing these regulations.
Again, with the same companies that made money on it.
And these are documented things.
Another fact that has already been published is that some governors in the United States have already officially submitted a report on the ""chase"",
explaining the ""chase"" literally, of the covid curfew, i.e. the introduction of dangerous substances into circulation,
which could and are fully aware that they were introduced, with full awareness that they could cause damage, even deaths.
And it was related to corruption.
So these are things that, in my opinion, will dominate at the beginning of 2023,
because people will be outraged by this lethargy, that the governments were taking care of their safety,
introducing radical regulations that are in contradiction, as in Poland, with the constitution.
With the regulations of the higher order, with the limitation of freedom, the right to move, the right to conduct economic activity.
After all, you certainly know that almost all prohibitions, prohibitions and penalties were later annulled by the courts, because they were inconsistent with the law.
As a contradiction with the constitution.
So what, we're going back to the sheep herd scheme, which is thoughtlessly following the voice of the shepherd, and the shepherd is not merciful to them?
Yes, and some kill. Exactly.
This is not the only thing that will probably dominate in 2023.
There are other international problems that are less heard about in Poland, we talk less about it.
But things are happening in the world arena that may have a very strong impact on us soon.
For example, the situation in China. What happened there?
Yes, we have to pay special attention to China in 2023, because in my opinion it will have an impact on the whole world.
On many levels. Of course, as an economist, I will pay the most attention to these economic aspects,
but as a human being I will also look very carefully at the political ones, including those related to the outbreak of even some conflict.
You are talking about a military conflict. Let's face it.
I would not like to use the words ""World War III"", but such thoughts may come to mind.
At this point, we will take a short break, we will return after a moment of music.

Our guest is an economist, financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
We felt that the war is quite possible after the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine.
For us, it appeared, for example, with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
So we see that it can have an impact on each of us.
Well, here I would like to debunk a myth.
And it's such a terrifying myth and widely believed to be true.
Number one. Currently, there are the most wars in the history of the world.
So it has never been as bad in the world as in recent years.
And contrary to what people think, it was the time when pro-peaceful international organizations were formed.
This should make you think.
Secondly, the gigantic concentration of power in one's hands or in a small amount of hands is usually a cause for anxiety or at least very careful observation of this person who decides.
The truth is that people who currently hold power are not controlled by anyone.
Not only that, most of them are not even elected by people.
A classic example - the EU authorities.
Did you elect them? Do you even know who elected them, who decides who rules Europe?
Well, it's a very complicated system of indirect elections.
Representatives elect other representatives, etc.
At some point, you lose complete control of it.
Well, again, one of my important parts of my career is being an expert in European finance.
For many years I taught at graduate schools.
I was the author of a book, one of the first in Poland, written jointly with people from the ministry on the subject of the European Funds.
So I also assume that I can speak quite sensibly in this area.
Believe me, the number of things, the number of absurdities, which a normal person is not even able to believe, and which are of course a fact.
I also learned this directly from the European Parliamentarians.
I was there, of course. I talked, I was there.
And believe me, it looks completely different than you might think, judging by leaks or media information.
Most authorities look different if you are close to them.
So believe me, people don't know a lot of things.
A lot of things that fundamentally change the whole way of looking at the world.
I am so lucky that my professional life is very closely related to business, finance, and often, unfortunately, also to politics.
I say unfortunately, because what I have learned, what I have learned, has changed my approach to it very, very much.
And I generally laugh that I have no political views.
Because I met people so high up, so close, most of whom I know from TV, that I look at political views completely differently.
At least political decisions.
And again, economic knowledge goes in the opposite direction.
The old Latin saying, ""If you want to reach the truth, follow the path of money.""
And this is a good advice, in my opinion, for every listener.
A short poem to sum up today's hearing.
The old year is over.
Summarizing time.
Where are the gains and increases?
Bitcoins?
Apartments?
Losses?
War, crisis, fuel prices are rising.
I have enough promises.
I think I will be smarter.
This will also be the goal of our hearing.
To talk about things that people do not quite understand, and often these are completely hidden issues.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you for the first time.
I hope we managed to interest and encourage the listeners.
We will be on the air again in a week.
This is ""Grany"", Mr. Mariusz.
See you.
Once again, our guest was the economist, financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Thank you very much.
The hearing was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
I checked a few forecasts from the year before, which were set for 2022, and few of them turned out to be prophetic.
Well, for example, the inflation forecast. Even the president of the National Bank of Poland was wrong.
I think it's quite typical. Why else?
Because he's an expert.
Yes, some say that, but I say that there is a lot of pressure on most of the experts I know from most of the areas I have contact with.
Even financial influence cases are documented on the position, opinion or decision of experts.
And I don't think it should be a shock to anyone.
Before we get to the topic, it's time to introduce our guest, and he is and will be our weekly guest, Mariusz Stefaniak.
A man who connects many fields, both as a practitioner and as a theorist.
Economist, financialist, manager, among other large IT companies, marketing specialist, and most of all, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Let's pay attention to the name - ""Więcej Mądrości"".
Every week we will meet regularly and talk about the economy and the complexity of the world.
Good morning, Mr. Mariusz.
Hello, I bow.
Let's get back to the topic.
An example of a wrong forecast is the housing market.
It was supposed to develop infinitely, prices were supposed to rise, demand was supposed to rise, and here it suddenly turns out that not so much.
Yes, this is a beautiful example.
Why were these forecasts so optimistic in this case?
Optimistic? There is only one answer, because this is what you earn.
And you earn huge money.
Please note that the real estate market is one of the most profitable markets in the world.
Developers earn, landowners earn, good business.
Governments earn, sir.
This is probably the most important.
A great example, for example, such an extreme, but the largest in the world, are China.
One day we can talk about it in detail, I will show the whole mechanism, a shocking mechanism, I assume for the majority.
For me, a completely standard thing in this industry.
I am saving topic number one for the next edition.
But we also have the cryptocurrency market, which has grown incredibly and it seemed that it would also grow all the time.
Yes, the forecasts were amazing.
I remember forecasts that said that in 2022 Bitcoin would cost 120, 140, 150 thousand dollars.
Well, how much it costs today, it's easy to see.
The mechanism itself, ladies and gentlemen, and it's easy to notice a certain scheme, because you make great money on it.
On recording something that we can safely call speculative banks.
But someone goes, someone else buys, agrees, accepts these prices.
So what, we have on the one hand, the players, and on the other hand, the sheep that go where they are told?
Exactly, you know it well.
This is how you can emphasize all events in the history of the world.
Sheep go to slaughter, and the shepherd benefits from it.
But let's get back to the topic of experts who predict and not always or rarely do they come across these predictions.
Do we have bad experts or do we have experts who work on someone else's order, not necessarily those who listen to them?
We definitely have good experts in the world and they are brilliant people, great specialists.
But a completely strange coincidence is not the people who are most liked and promoted by the government, the media or large corporations.
They can't get through with their message to the mass media, to public information.
Yes, because this message warns the sheep that they are going to slaughter.
Well, the shepherd can't like such a message, please forgive me, no shepherd will agree to someone who will warn the sheep before entering the slaughterhouse.
Well, because they will rebel.
Well, or they will go the other way, because it will suddenly turn out that the shepherd cannot handle hundreds of thousands of sheep at once.
Unless the sheep will follow the sheep that leads them.
Well, Mr. Marysia, but maybe we live in very unpredictable times, maybe it was simply not possible to predict the war and the attack of Russia on Ukraine.
Well, the facts speak differently, sir.
The facts that have been documented beyond any doubt are that at least 7 months earlier, the largest governments had 100% certain data on the attack.
What will it be, how will it be, where will it be? These are the facts. It was even half-published.
It didn't get to the public opinion.
It did, you just have to know where to read it.
At this point, we will take a short break, we will be back after a moment of music.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz? We're back on the air. Our guest is an economist, a financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Mr. Mariusz, one of the examples of events, actually global events, which dominated the world public opinion for a very long time and suddenly stopped, is the COVID pandemic.
Two years ago, it was number one on all news, everyone was afraid of the pandemic. Suddenly, we stopped being afraid of it.
Is COVID still a real threat? Was it a real threat to us?
It was, without a doubt, but not as people believed.
What do you mean?
I mean, COVID was and is a deadly threat, but economically, financially, socially, that's its main, crushing, deadly force.
But the virus attacks humans, not the economy.
You're right, but from what I know, we absorb a huge amount of viruses every day and somehow we live. And you've known that for thousands, thousands, thousands of years.
And if you checked the scientific facts, what I did at the beginning of the pandemic, because I didn't know either, of course, I'm not an omnibus, so I learned.
And what I saw solved most of the questions for the next two years.
But I can also show you exactly what I did, how I did it and how I ended up.
Because it's slowly coming out and it's coming out on a gigantic scale. And it will be coming out for at least another year, that's for sure.
So let him tell you a little more.
For example, I will give you simple facts that are published again, so I will be able to verify what I say very quickly.
For example, in a mysterious way, contracts with the largest companies that have received vaccines around the world have disappeared.
And officials from the European Union are not able to present contracts on the basis of which they bought and introduced vaccines to the circulation.
They even forced people to take it, at least they persuaded, and at times they forced.
And now they are not able to show these documents on the basis of which they did it.
And in other countries similar things are happening.
And please believe me that this is only going to get deeper.
In addition, there were also evident financial links between the most important officials who were responsible for implementing these regulations,
again with the same companies that were making money on it.
And these are documented things.
Another fact that has already been published is that some governors in the United States have already officially submitted a report on the pursuit,
the explanation of the pursuit of the COVID-19 curfew,
that is, the introduction of dangerous substances into circulation,
which could and are fully aware that they were introduced,
with full awareness that they could cause damage, even deaths,
and it was associated with corruption.
So these are things that, in my opinion, will dominate at the beginning of 2023,
because people will be outraged by this lethargy,
that governments were taking care of their safety by introducing radical regulations that are in contradiction,
such as, for example, in Poland with the Constitution,
with the regulations of the higher order,
with the limitation of freedom,
the right to move,
the right to conduct economic activity.
After all, you certainly know that almost all prohibitions, prohibitions and penalties were later annulled by the courts,
because they were inconsistent with the law.
As a contradiction with the Constitution.
So what, we're going back to the sheep herd scheme again,
which are mindlessly following the voice of the shepherd,
and the shepherd is not merciful to them?
Yes, and some kill. Exactly.
This is not the only thing that will probably dominate in 2023.
There are other international problems that are less heard about in Poland,
we talk less about it,
but things are happening in the world arena that may have a very strong impact on us soon.
For example, the situation in China.
What happened there?
Yes, we have to pay special attention to China in 2023,
because in my opinion it will have an impact on the whole world.
On many levels.
Of course, as an economist, I will pay the most attention to these economic aspects,
but as a human being I will also look very carefully at political ones,
including those related to the outbreak of even some conflict.
You are talking about a military conflict.
Let's face it.
I would not like to use the words ""World War III"",
but such thoughts may come to mind.
At this point, we will take a short break,
we will be back after a moment of music.

Our guest is an economist, financier, expert Mariusz Stefaniak.
We felt that the war is quite possible after the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine.
For us, it appeared, for example, with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
So we see that it can have an impact on each of us.
Well, here I would like to debunk a myth.
And it's such a terrifying myth and widely believed to be true.
Number one. Currently, there are the most wars in the history of the world.
So it has never been as bad in the world as in recent years.
And contrary to what people think,
it was the time when pro-peaceful international organs were formed.
This should make you think.
Secondly, the gigantic concentration of power in one hand or in a small amount of hands
is usually a reason for anxiety or at least for very careful observation of this person who decides.
The truth is that people who currently hold power are not controlled by anyone.
Not only that, most of them are not even elected by people.
A classic example is the EU authorities.
Did you elect them?
Do you know who elected them, who decides who rules Europe?
Well, it's a very complicated system of indirect elections.
Representatives elect other representatives and so on and so forth.
At some point, you lose complete control over it.
Well, again, one of my important parts of my professional life is being an expert when it comes to European finance, European funds.
For many years, I have been teaching at graduate schools, I am the author of a book,
one of the first in Poland, written jointly with people from the Ministry,
on the subject of funds, the implementation of European funds.
So I also assume that I can speak quite sensibly in this area.
Believe me, the number of things, the number of absurdities,
which a normal person is not even able to believe, and which are of course a fact,
I also learned it directly from the European Parliamentarians,
because I was there, of course, I talked, I was there.
And believe me, it looks completely different than you could ever guess,
judging by leaks or some media information.
Most authorities look different if you are close to these authorities.
So please believe me, people don't know a lot of things.
A lot of things that fundamentally change the whole world view.
Well, I say, I am so lucky that my professional life is very closely related to business, finance,
and often, unfortunately, also with politics.
I say unfortunately, because what I have learned, what I have learned, has very, very, very changed my approach to it.
And I generally laugh that I have no political views.
Because I met people so highly positioned, so close, most of whom I know from TV,
that I look at political views completely differently.
At least political decisions.
And again, economic knowledge goes into the abyss.
The old Latin saying, ""If you want to reach the truth, follow the path of money.""
And this is a good advice, in my opinion, for every listener.
A short poem to sum up today's audition.
The old year is over.
Time to sum up.
Where are the gains and increases?
Bitcoins?
Apartments?
Losses?
War, crisis, fuel prices are rising.
I have enough promises.
I think I'm getting smarter.
This will also be the goal of our audition.
To talk about things that people don't quite understand, and often these are completely hidden matters.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you for the first time.
I hope we managed to interest and encourage the listeners.
We will be on the air again in a week.
This is ""Grany"", Mr. Mariusz.
Until next time.
Once again, our guest was an economist, financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Thank you very much.
The audition was conducted by Krzysztof Strauchman.
Inne Radio in Głuchołazy and the area 105,2.

[MUSIC]
What's going on Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
In Business Insider I read that 8 American billionaires lost almost $ 400 billion in total last year.
I wonder how you can lose such money.
They drank it, someone stole it, took it, invested badly, went bankrupt. What happened?
Good question. Because, indeed, such amounts are falling and I have seen such calculations.
Not only that, I would add that it looks even more interesting.
Because, for example, the Kilon Mask estate has decreased by more than half.
So these are not just the billions that are abstract for all of us,
but we are talking about the fact that one of the richest people in the world lost half of his property.
Literally in a dozen months.
The same goes for Jeff Bezos and many others.
We are talking about the world's largest companies.
We are not talking about, as you say, bad investments and so on.
No, no, no.
We are talking about their leading key businesses suddenly falling in value.
How do you estimate the value of such people's assets?
Taking it literally from space.
It is not based on a hard number. Someone says accounting is a very mathematical thing.
In this case, unfortunately, not at all.
Because how to estimate real estate in Manhattan?
How do you calculate it exactly?
How do we know how much it is worth?
Do you calculate the value of bricks?
No. I can compare it to the values of similar real estate sold before.
Or the needs and possibilities of people who would like to buy.
In short, we are talking about demand and sale.
This is a classic case. How much is a bottle of Coca-Cola worth?
As much as someone who buys wants to pay.
Yes. If you offer me this bottle in the desert when I die of thirst, it will be worth all the money.
It is exactly the same with these prices.
Of course, it is not as dramatic as with Coca-Cola.
But sometimes psychology plays the most important role in prices.
There are companies that are trendy.
In the style of Tesla, it happened.
And suddenly its shares skyrocketed several dozen times.
Shares that were worth $ 10-15 in 2019, then began to be worth $ 100-200-300-400.
These are absurd values.
And now the question is what happened?
For a year or two with this company, it has grown from $ 10 to $ 400 per share.
What happened? It became popular.
But what happened now? It is losing.
They started to produce something that did not go into the market.
They made a mistake. Such money does not go away for no reason.
You are right. They do not go away for no reason.
There are many reasons.
I will give one. China.
Tesla invested huge amounts of money in mega factories in China.
And then it would seem that it is a brilliant move.
Today, when there were lockdowns, strikes, and now China is closing in on the US economy,
the so-called trade war between China and the US,
at this point, this Tesla factory in China is rather a burden, a problem, than a profit.
Investors are not idiots.
Not all, but most investors are not idiots.
So they noticed it all.
For example, one detail.
The lack of battery availability.
Tension on the Taiwan-China line.
Because it may suddenly turn out that we will not have chips, we will not have batteries for all these devices.
The same with Apple.
A big strike of the factory in China.
Exactly in the Apple factory in China.
And at this point, suddenly, what is a company worth that cannot produce anything?
Because there is nowhere.
And what control does it have over it?
The answer is exactly none.
Because it is decided by the Chinese government, and what happened in China.
They have no influence on it.
That's what it's about.
This is one aspect.
The second aspect is that, what I have repeatedly signaled for years,
against the opinion of the media,
that there is a huge crisis.
Finally, what I have been saying since 2018, very loudly,
is that it is now reaching the public space.
And people say, ""Damn, there is a huge crisis.""
So, indicators of all industries are falling.
All tech industries are going down.
Of course, they are not going down so terribly, as we say here,
that, I don't know, about half and so on.
No, no, no.
But it still shows that these are symptoms of a certain threat.
Such black clouds that are gathering.
Investors also don't like it.
Because the future doesn't look bright for them.
So this is the second aspect.
Because in 2022, miracles happened.
The shares went up?
Damn.
Don't look for sense there, because it's a pity for the West.
Before you buy shares, put your head in the ice.
At this point, we will take a short break.
We will be back after a moment of music.

We're back to our broadcast.
Once again, we have Mariusz Stefaniak in front of us.
Economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Mr. Mariusz, what's going on?
We talked about the fact that billionaires, Americans, lost a huge fortune,
but the prices of the shares of the most famous American companies also fell.
Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Apple, Meta.
Giants, entertainment.
What's going on?
We stop watching TV.
Is this a sign of a crisis?
Has the crisis affected only a few industries?
Indeed, this has not been observed in recent years.
Needless to say, the entertainment industry has experienced a boom.
Especially in recent decades.
These were amazing years for them.
Of course, during the pandemic, cinemas were closed in the United States.
We did not feel it that way, but Americans rely heavily on the cinema network.
It's a different culture, so it works differently for them.
Big companies earn a significant part of their wealth by distributing cinema tickets.
These are hundreds of millions of dollars from one movie.
It's a lot of money, even for them.
It was a breakthrough year in 2022, because the biggest productions,
the biggest film studios stopped making money and started to bring significant losses.
We are talking about losses of $200 million.
We are talking about such amounts from one movie.
Indeed, it is shocking and there are quite a few reasons for this.
Please start counting, because I'm curious what you mean.
A classic example, which was a breakthrough example, was ""Rings of Power"" from Tolkien's world.
The previous releases from this world were the biggest hits in the history of cinema.
We are talking about screenings made by Peter Jackson.
And here, suddenly, the biggest company, Amazon, and Amazon Studio,
put out an unprecedented amount of money in the industry.
Almost a billion dollars for one movie.
This has never been seen, even in Hollywood, with the biggest productions.
What turned out?
That it was a total crushing, terrifying blow.
But it's even deeper, because they announced a success.
All the media claimed that it was an incredible success,
that it was the number one hit in the world,
that for the next few decades people would be delighted with what they had created.
But this was a violent dispute with the opinions of people like us, ordinary viewers,
and independent experts, who are not too many,
they are not particularly loud, but they are great experts,
who do not appear in mainstream media.
And there was a very brutal fight between a gigantic company,
which, to put it brutally, paid, bought, you could say, critics,
and even bought out all the companies that evaluate movies,
ranking these movies.
They just bought these products and put out the best opinions.
You understand the absurdity of this situation.
But this is the standard in the industry at the moment.
Of course, people were watching this until a moment,
when something so terribly expected came out.
It was incredibly strong here.
That people were expecting something brilliant,
and waited a few years for the production to be produced,
and they knew that the money put into it would be unprecedented,
so they were expecting something monumental, you know.
When you invest several times more money in the same product,
you say, ""Oh, this product will be much better.""
So you buy a car, you have a Skoda,
and now a Skoda will come out, which they put, let's say,
five times as much money to produce.
It comes out and you say, ""Damn, but this is a bargain,
it's not even comparable to the Skoda I had, which was five times cheaper.""
It's just a bargain.
And you get pissed off.
Alfira says, ""No, no, this is the best car in the world,
you should be happy, but I'm pissed off at you.""
And exactly that was the case.
But then a whole wave of similar situations followed.
A classic example from our backyard,
Sapkowski and Wiedźmin, one of the coolest brands
that came out of Poland and became a leading world brand in the entertainment sphere.
And again, a powerful company made a series out of it
and just destroyed, destroyed in a scandalous way
Sapkowski's brilliant creativity,
the brilliant achievement of our gaming studio,
which promoted Polish culture, history and Polish stories.
And suddenly the fans went mad.
Even the leading actor who played Geralt of Rivia left.
In a sign of protest that they were destroying,
so they were laughing, apparently, those who created this series,
they were laughing at Sapkowski's book, they were laughing at our production.
They were just getting drunk from what they had created.
You know, such absurdities.
And it's not just about the books, it's about the movies you mentioned.
We can literally go through them one by one
and you'll find out that they're just laughing at their own clients.
They say they're idiots, nerds, naive, stupid.
And you know, you can see that approach.
And people at some point stopped accepting it,
which at the same time resulted in, as we mentioned in the previous segment,
a general decline in the market.
And that's the situation we're in.
Mr. Mariusz, I think we'll discuss the topic of what's happening in mass culture,
how it affects the economy and the situation in the world
in our next meeting,
where I'm already inviting our listeners
on Saturday and Sunday at 10.30,
which is played by our guest, Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
Thank you very much for the meeting and for the conversation.
Thank you very much and I also invite our listeners. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Krzysztof Strauchman.

[MUSIC]
What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
To be honest, I was inspired by our conversation from a week ago
about how unsuccessful TV series produced in recent or previous years
affect the course of action of large companies producing movies.
I started looking for data on the Internet about the number of viewers and ticket inflows
of the famous series ""The Ring of Power"".
While Amazon, the producer, boasted a lot before the distribution of this series
how much it invested in its production,
that it cost a record $1 billion in the history of cinema,
it's hard to find enough data about how much it earned.
Is it a sign that the movie was a financial flop?
It doesn't necessarily have to be a sign, but it gives a disturbing signal.
That something is wrong.
If we have something to boast about, why don't we boast?
Because we are modest.
No, we know that Amazon Studio and Jeff Bezos are not modest people.
They love to boast about their successes, their numbers, achievements.
So it makes you think. You're right.
Especially since in previous series or movies that were cash successes
they were officially stated how much they earned
and they earned several times more than their production cost.
This one should earn several billion dollars.
Yes, it definitely is.
There were even announcements, sometimes even a little exaggerated,
because they claimed that 60 years after the release of ""Rings of Power""
it will be a hit and people will watch it.
So I think it will be a mega hit for decades.
And as you mentioned, the very look at the predecessor sets a high bar.
For example, in 2004, ""The Lord of the Rings"" won 11 Oscars.
So in all categories nominated.
It's impressive.
All three parts won 30 nominations, of which 17.
So let's admit it's a high bar.
In terms of money, money is also impressive.
Let's say that for the invested 93 million dollars in ""Fellowship of the Ring""
which is the first part,
this part earned something over 377 million dollars.
And it was the same with every other part.
The first trilogy earned about 300-380 million dollars.
Every part.
There were also additional parts, extended versions, etc.
Each of them also earned millions of dollars.
The same with ""The Hobbit"", which was the smallest part
and also artificially divided from one book into a trilogy.
It also earned an average of 250 million dollars per part.
These are gigantic amounts.
We're talking about the fact that from a small amount of money
the company earned a billion dollars from the tickets themselves.
Where they invested 90 million dollars for the film.
It's impressive, let's be honest.
So the expectations for ""Rings of Power"" were gigantic.
Mr. Mariusz, we should start with the explanation.
We owe it to our listeners.
The point is to show why the film industry is different from other types of industries.
Steel production, car production.
What is this business different from? Why is it so important?
A good question.
It's important because of the amount of money in the media business.
Entertainment, as they call it.
Broadly speaking, entertainment.
But the key to the puzzle is not here.
Because it's a socially important business.
Because it shapes people's minds and views.
Which affects all their life decisions.
It shapes the whole country and society.
And the powers of this world know it perfectly and use it effectively.
So it's about power and propaganda.
Not just about pure money.
He called it a bunch of crap, but it's true.
It's about power and propaganda.
We'll take a break and be back in a moment.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation,
financial economist.
And the topic of our conversation today is
the situation of the film industry
and how successful or unsuccessful productions
affect the financial results of companies.
But not only. Mr. Mariusz, we talked about
the ""Ring of Power"" series
produced by Amazon.
And what is it like compared to other superproductions
from the last year?
Did they also make such spectacular hits?
Well, the answer is not unambiguous.
Because I personally found a common denominator
that perfectly shows
when something will be a hit
and when it will be a success.
What were the gigantic hits?
The ""Ring of Power"" series
is definitely at the top.
Because it was a breakthrough
on many levels of the phenomenon.
What else was so incredibly unsuccessful?
Undoubtedly, ""The Witcher"".
Sarah the Witcher,
who is known and loved
all over the world,
was so terribly disfigured
that the audience
was massively running away.
Including the main character,
Henry Cavill,
who simply gave up
the gigantic money
he earned there.
This is, of course, a classic example
of Star Wars,
one of the biggest sagas
in the history of cinema,
which, from part to part,
was an increasing disappointment.
It also led the audience
to fury.
What was done with this great title.
A great universe
created by George Lucas.
But of course,
it is not so unambiguous.
Because there are the freshest productions.
""Maverick"" with Tom Cruise,
which is a great success.
""Avatar"", which earns billions
at the same time as other companies
lose billions.
So what is the common denominator
of all these films?
Exactly. That's why I asked myself
such a question, analyzing the economic results.
And you know what I came to?
The answer is simple. Ideology.
Ideology is a common denominator, sir.
These films were dominated
by ideology?
Yes. And this specific ideology.
In Poland we do not have
such a word, but in the West
it is called ""woke"". ""Wokeness"".
Well, I heard. It is also penetrating into Poland.
It is slowly adapting
to the current situation.
And this is the key word
to the mystery of economic failures
or profits.
There is such a famous saying
now, a real meme.
""Get woke, go broke"".
So stay woke, i.e. enlightened
and go bankrupt.
The film and entertainment industry
in particular
is a carrier
of certain cultural values.
These richest people,
who actually run these companies.
Let's be honest,
no one poor and average has a film studio
in Hollywood.
And they randomly launch
certain ideologies.
And these ideologies say
that it is a beautiful ideology.
Something like communism.
That everyone is equal.
That we must help people who are excluded.
Who are in the minority.
Who do not have such a voice as you.
Great ideals, right?
Well, the ideals of equality
were always very eagerly heard
and promoted.
And what is the practice of implementing these ideals?
I found a short definition
of the woke ideology.
That it is not equality, but it is an obsession.
Obsession on the point of gender,
on the point of sexual orientation
or climate change.
So this is something that is totally
overwritten.
Yes, because at the beginning
all ideologies, if you look at the history
of the communist era, we want
the oppressed workers not to be oppressed.
That these great scammers
were not such tyrants.
They did not steal people.
After all, we want everyone to live better.
Beautiful.
But let's look at the implementation
of this in practice.
Hundreds of millions of victims,
destroyed houses, culture, society,
bloody slaughter.
This is what the implementation of these beautiful slogans
looks like in practice.
We will come back to you in a moment.

The previous iteration of Peter Jackson's beloved movie had a rating level, I quote here from one of the most famous and respected rating portals, 91% in the critic's rating and 95% in the viewer's rating.
So practically perfect, almost perfect, almost everyone was delighted.
Let's put it together with the Ring of Power, sir. You have 38% here for the plus from the point of view of the viewers and 85% of the critics.
Of course, it came out very brutally, because people say that the critics are blind, they did not watch the same as we did.
It turns out that these are just bought reviews.
Brutally. In addition, there were such paradoxes that Amazon began to buy viewers in some countries to start watching, because the results of the viewing were so terrible, they are so terrible that for a whole week they were not published at all.
And people watched individual episodes.
They started paying viewers for watching because the results were so terrifyingly terrible.
This is something incredible in the film industry. That you pay the viewer to want to see what you have produced, because you want it to be a success so much, and it is such a big failure.
Mr. Mariusz, but we live in an open society, the presence of black actors on the screen, the presence of homosexuals or people playing homosexuals in films is no longer surprising anyone.
What is it about? Why is this a problem for the audience?
I agree, I absolutely agree with you, because I have not heard any opinions that someone has interfered with the fact that someone has put black elves in the Legendarium or black transhuman women and so on.
I have not heard such negative opinions.
But I have heard opinions that, for example, bad actors, bad showrunners, bad directors, bad bosses of studios were put in, because they are elected from the political, ideological key.
It reminds me of the times of political commissars in the socialist union, who, no matter how competent they were as managers or commanders, they always had a decisive voice.
They force people with low competences into us, because they fit the ideology or the denominator, how many percent are supposed to be homosexuals in the film.
Because that's exactly what the percentages are.
How many people are supposed to be of a certain skin color, of a certain minority?
Nobody cares if they are great actors, hopeless or average.
They have to be there, because otherwise the film will not be funded.
And this is really something that drives people mad.
Because not only do they put in weak actors, but if you don't like the film, you'll be called a racist.
And a lot of other adjectives.
And this is exactly what led to, you can say openly, the rebellion of fans, the rebellion of viewers, because they just want good shows.
And not ideological, propaganda, poor quality videos.
That's what it was about.
We have to finish our conversation.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
A financial expert, an economist.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you.

The conversation was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
And what did you hear there again?
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is an economist, financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Mr. Mariusz, I read the information from the Office of Credit Information,
which stated that we have our own ""ice age"" when it comes to housing loans.
In previous years, Poles took housing loans for grant,
and now they don't.
As if they didn't want to build houses or buy flats.
The data of this office show that the amount of loans has fallen
to 30% of what we borrowed a year ago.
Development companies are already crying, literally,
that they won't have anyone to build for in a moment.
However, I have not found any information anywhere
that significant housing prices have dropped,
which should probably happen in this situation.
We talked in August last year,
and you predicted a crisis in the housing market
and you predicted a decrease.
Will these decreases occur?
So yes, let me not agree with these theses.
Poles want to buy flats and want to borrow.
Banks stopped wanting to give them money.
Next.
According to the data I have,
prices are falling for both flats and rent.
For example, I will quote here,
""The rent rates have fallen slightly
after 10 months of continuous increases,
according to the report of Expandera and Rentier.io.
In October, the rent was 9 out of 16 poor cities,
2 out of 16 rates did not change,
and 5 out of 16 further increases were noted.""
Let's read on.
""Thanks to the decline in housing prices,
the average rent of an apartment investment
has increased to 5.54 net,
which is equivalent to a flat with a 6.84% interest rate.""
So if you analyze the numbers on the market,
it turns out that prices are falling.
Of course, if we look even deeper into the data,
it will turn out that last year there were significant increases
resulting from the gigantic inflow of millions of refugees from Ukraine.
So all of this means that despite this abnormal system of things,
because no normal country is able to accept
a few, as we had, 4 million officially Ukrainians
who entered the Polish border,
this is not a normal situation in any country in the world.
And no real estate market could behave well in this situation,
because it is an unhealthy, unnatural situation.
If despite this, at the end of the year,
and here I read the data from December 2022,
it indicates that what I predicted,
I remember that I said that to make it more or less make sense,
the decline should be at the level of 30% of the value of the housing price.
- You said so.
- Yes, I remember that.
So if you look at the current data,
where 4 million people have flown,
that is, people who have to live somewhere,
and despite this, there are drops.
Of course, these drops are after the wave of growth.
Why?
Because 4 million people have flown to rent a flat,
to buy a flat and to rent a flat.
But despite everything, our market was totally unequal.
That is why these prices must fall.
There is no way out.
If the Ukrainians left,
please believe me, what I predicted,
it would be too little to slow down the market crash now.
300% drops would not help.
This is absolutely obvious to me.
- You said that Poles want to take out loans and build apartments,
but banks stopped giving them.
Banks also have to adapt to the situation,
even to inflation and the so-called reference rate
established by the National Bank of Poland,
which is high.
Loans have become expensive.
Is this only the effect of inflation,
or are there other elements to it?
- Inflation has nothing to do with it, to be honest.
Inflation is a key word
to explain to people who have no idea about the economy,
why it is bad in the economy.
One day we can do a whole hearing about inflation
and I assume it will be an incredibly interesting experience for you,
when I present to you scientific facts, economic knowledge,
a little more in-depth than what you hear, see and read.
- What if it's not inflation?
- The topic is very serious and deep,
so it's hard for me to explain it in one sentence,
so that listeners who are not economists can understand it.
Generally speaking, let's say it's an unhealthy market system
and all of this is the effect of it.
It's like the effect of a disease that affects the Polish economy,
and the real estate market in particular.
So this is one of the symptoms.
- We're taking a break here, but we'll be back in a moment.
Please do not leave the radio.

Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist and financial advisor to the Foundation ""Więcej Mądrości"".
Today we're talking about the situation on the real estate market.
A moment ago, Mr. Mariusz said that the situation is structurally unhealthy.
I think the government and the Polish authorities are starting to notice that it's unhealthy,
because they've started to come up with all kinds of ideas to improve the situation.
Among others, the idea of imposing additional fees on companies
that buy flats in bulk, more than once.
This additional fee is supposed to protect Poles who are not able to compete,
at least that's what they're assuming,
and whether it will lead to a drop in the price of a square meter of housing,
because that's probably what it's all about.
- Okay, I'll put it this way.
In my opinion, that's not what it's all about,
because the government doesn't care in any way
and shouldn't care about the drop in the price of housing.
But again, that's a separate topic,
we can go deeper into it some time.
It's better to look at China, for example,
because there it's so exaggerated, so shown on such a scale,
that everything will be perfectly visible.
Then the listeners will quickly transfer this model to the Polish market
and they will understand why what I said makes sense.
It's not about lowering the price of housing at all.
That's one thing.
Secondly, will this stop the domination in any way,
because we're talking about big entities on the real estate market.
Absolutely not.
I can't imagine anyone with any real economic or technical knowledge
being able to believe it.
Because think about it.
For decades, these companies have been buying the best locations,
the best places, because they had practically unlimited capital.
Poles had to do it with credit.
You saw that most of the apartments that were bought were bought on credit.
So people like that will always lose to gigantic multinational corporations.
It's obvious.
And now, again, a simple fact.
We have the highest housing prices in decades.
And think about it.
An experienced investor.
These big companies are experienced investors.
They buy thousands of apartments, sometimes in dozens of different countries.
So only an idiot buys on the so-called ""high"",
only when something is the most expensive.
And the experienced investor buys when something is super cheap.
They did it exactly.
In short, they did the best business they could.
Now, when they are no longer interested in buying, because at these prices it doesn't make much sense for them,
suddenly the government came up with a brilliant idea to limit the people who bought.
But they already bought everything they could, what they wanted.
Nothing blocked them.
The milk was distributed, right?
Cards were distributed.
And now we won't be cheating.
Schuller chose the cards he wanted.
Do you think this is a fair game now?
Really?
Less will be built, but at least more people will buy, ordinary people will buy these apartments.
They won't have competition.
No.
No.
First of all, a simple fact.
Official data already published says that developers are holding investments.
It is literally predicted that there will be a shortage of apartments in the perspective of two years.
This is a cover-up of the Board of Directors of the Polish Development Association.
I think people know what they are talking about, right?
The industry speaks, yes.
This is their business.
Exactly.
So if they already clearly announce that investments are being held,
what I said, that some of the investments were still in flow, some developers had financial resources,
so they could afford to hold them, but I told you that it would end.
Do you remember?
Yes, this is a large industry that is slowing down.
Exactly, because it is a giant.
As if you wanted to stop an elephant.
The elephant does not stop immediately.
Slowing down such a mass takes time.
So here we have exactly such an effect.
But it happened.
They already announced it.
Yes, we are slowing down, we are already closing investments, we are not opening new ones.
These are the facts.
I predicted it a year ago.
And people were shouting, I remember everything on the newspaper headlines,
""No, no, it's temporary, it's developing here, everything will be beautiful.""
No, it won't.
And we meet after a year and it is not.
Mr. Marysia, but the government proposes another solution.
Since the Poles lack money, we will give them the money.
Buy more apartments, we will help you, we will give you a supplement to buy the first apartment,
financing of various types for municipalities that build communal apartments.
More money, just common money, because these are the money from our taxes.
Some people get it, but we will definitely all pay for it.
Can this affect the market situation and the maintenance of this housing and construction HOSS?
It will definitely affect the next patch of our already damaged, sick housing market.
So it will only be another beating of a bullet horse.
Kick him more, why not?
He's still walking, so we can still kick him, right?
But it sounds good, we can help him, Adam, buy his first apartment.
Well, I guess everyone would do that, father, parents, guardian.
You're right, it sounds good, but I can share here with you and the viewers a certain maxim,
which I did not invent to make it clear, but I really liked it.
What is good for politicians is bad for the economy, and what is good for the economy is bad for politicians.
And what is good for people?
What is good for the economy, so it's bad for politicians.
A healthy economy is good for people, right?
But very bad for politicians, for great, powerful people, companies, entities.
For them it is the greatest tragedy.
For normal people it is the greatest happiness.
These are the facts.
We're taking a break here, but we'll be back to the subject in a moment.
Please do not leave the radio receivers.
The end

Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the FED.
I'm Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the FED.
Today we're talking about the situation on the housing market.
It reminds me of the saying ""In a murky water it's best to fish"",
and the more regulations and regulations, the more murky the water is.
Undoubtedly, yes.
And who can afford super lawyers, advisors and specialists?
An ordinary Kowalski who wants to buy the only apartment in his life?
No way.
A gigantic corporation that buys hundreds and thousands of such apartments.
The whole estate.
They can afford it. They will have the best tax relief, the best relief, the best evasion of fines.
Because they can afford it.
Not only that, they can even afford the so-called ""lobbying"",
which is, to put it bluntly, bribery of the rulers.
Because they come in with billions, so for them giving 10 million in cash is a fraction of what they will earn on it.
No one is able to influence politicians, rulers, officials.
No one normal is able to.
But the giants are.
That's why the regulations are for them.
As you said.
And there is one more element in all of this.
Credit is sometimes taken for 20-30 years.
It requires some faith in the future, that everything will be fine, that I will be able to pay off this loan, that I will earn.
Does not taking these loans mean that the moods have fallen and we have lost this faith in the future?
As I said, it's not that we have lost faith in the future.
People would take it, because people are not too smart, unfortunately, they do not learn.
But, that banks do not want to give anymore.
That's all.
If banks would suddenly say ""Ok, we give you super preferential loans"", the queue would stand.
It's obvious.
So people are not smarter at all, it's not that something has improved.
No, those who were not sensible and did not have economic knowledge, are still not sensible and do not have economic knowledge.
That's all.
Like an alcoholic who suddenly cannot buy a bottle of vodka, is he suddenly smarter because he does not drink?
No, he does not drink because he was not sold vodka and he does not have money for it.
That's it. Simple.
He would still be willing to buy.
Do you understand?
This is such an example.
And this is why this audition is, among other things, to have more wisdom in society and to make smarter decisions.
Thank you very much for today's conversation and I invite you next week.
Thank you.
I was Maciej Stefaniak, economist, financial expert, the ""Foundation for more wisdom"" and the conversation was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
I found the data of the main statistical office, which concern the end of the last year.
It turns out that Poles are increasingly suspending their companies and are not in a hurry to open new ones, at least not at the pace as before.
This is how it is with the market economy, that someone will succeed, someone will fall, someone will fail.
Is the current scale of this phenomenon different from what has been happening in Poland so far?
Can it indicate something bad in our economy?
I think so.
Almost every third entrepreneur thinks about closing the company, and every second one would look for a job at the stage.
We read in the studies of the ESA Business from 2002.
Maybe I'll give a few facts.
Poles are leaders in entrepreneurship on a global scale.
For example, 78% of Poles believe that running your own business is a good idea.
This is the second highest result among 21 countries studied in Europe and the tenth among 50 countries in the world.
So we respect businessmen.
We are entrepreneurs.
Amazingly, and on a global scale.
Not only that, we like entrepreneurs.
77% of Poles believe that people who run a business and are successful should be recognized.
This is the sixth highest result in Europe.
So there is a will, there is respect, but unfortunately all these positives destroy the media.
You don't mean the Gazeta Telewizji?
I mean all of this.
In 2016, 58% wrote positively, and in 2019, after three years, only 37%.
It's a drop by half.
These are the studies from CBOS.
This shows what's going on.
Poles are an incredibly entrepreneurial nation.
We respect entrepreneurs, but the sudden external factors are disturbing us.
But you're not suggesting that the media are running a campaign that is aimed at entrepreneurship.
No, I have no evidence for that.
I'm talking about facts, not speculations or assumptions.
I'm talking about facts.
These are the facts.
But a Polish entrepreneur is strong enough not to care about media reports and just does his own thing.
I'm convinced of that.
That's right, but again, more data.
In 2019, only 6% of Poles wanted to start a company in the next three years, so until 2022.
And this is a result half lower than the average European.
So suddenly, from the leader, we fall into people who don't want to start a business.
Not that they don't want to.
So we're much worse off than the average in Europe.
This must show some disturbing trends.
Because I have some great, positive data.
For example, Poles outnumber the average European in the number of existing, already mature businesses.
So about 13% to 8% in Europe.
So almost twice as much.
But again, in all other aspects, young, new and established businesses, we fall below the average European again.
These are really disturbing data.
For the last 9 years, the index of young companies has decreased from 9% to 5.4% in Poland.
While the index of mature companies has increased from 5% to 12.8%.
I suspect that it's the income that decides.
Mature companies have a good situation and earn well, while young ones, unfortunately, have a hard time.
That's why no one wants to start them.
But why in Europe and other countries it's not like that?
Maybe they use more support from the surrounding, generally the state.
I suspect that it's exactly as you said.
Because, as far as I remember, Poland is in second place in Europe and 10th in the world among the countries with the most complex business rules.
So it's the Global Business Complexity Index 2021.
So we are in the lead, where it's the most difficult to run a business.
And we're talking about 10th place in the world, 2nd in Europe.
So we're at the very bottom when it comes to conditions.
Which, as you rightly noticed, may lead to the fact that we want less and less.
In addition, as we said, the media do not encourage the introduction, do not build a positive image of a businessman.
The same is confirmed by the so-called National Index of Entrepreneurship Conditions, where we are at the very end.
15th place out of 22.
Well, that's not encouraging.
Funny.
Do you know who is in first place?
Romania? Bulgaria?
No, Switzerland.
Because it's the best there.
That's why rich countries have much higher indicators, so it's better to run a business there.
Where it's bad to run a business, unfortunately, the indicators will be low.
I will only add that Poland got the same points as Belarus.
And it's better to leave it without comment.
And, above all, there are also modern or current two years of difficulties related to energy increases.
But we'll come back to this topic after the break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz? We're talking with Mariusz Stefaniak,
the president of the ""More Wisdom"" Foundation, an economist and a financial expert.
Today, we're talking about small businesses.
Mr. Mariusz, the logic indicates that countries with a lot of income,
countries that make a lot of money, should create the best, the easiest conditions for small business development.
Taking into account that small and medium-sized businesses are a very important part of our national product.
Why is it not so? Why is it easier to run a business in a rich Switzerland?
You've brought up a great topic.
The answer is simple.
The Swiss like Swiss companies and the Swiss government promotes Swiss companies.
In Poland, the government and regulations hate Polish companies, Poles running companies.
I'll give you a simple example.
The tax on CIT is only 0.004% of the company's income, which is less than 0.5%, not 19% as the Polish companies pay.
What kind of business will fall at higher costs in a smaller market, with fewer customers, etc.?
It's obvious.
Instead of paying 1.8 million CIT taxes, Osho should pay 510 million taxes.
If you list all the years of activity, and count the dozens of such huge businesses,
it turns out that Poland would be mega-rich, not mega-involved.
On the other hand, Mr. Mariusz, I also came across some data,
which shows that in 2021, public assistance provided to various companies,
including Polish TV, amounted to PLN 76 billion.
That's over 10% of our annual budget.
Among other things, 300,000 small companies benefited from this assistance.
It was mainly about various Covid shields.
So what? On the one hand, we prefer big companies, and we give money to small ones.
This is some kind of double-crossing.
Let's ask where this assistance comes from.
Do you know that you have been working for half of your life for Danina?
And as an economist, I don't want you to give me anything,
just stop taking it from me.
Then people who are smart and hard-working will live well,
and not stupid and lazy.
Let's promote those who know how to do something,
not those who don't know how to do something.
But we live in a time when there are more and more state regulations,
and society simply demands them.
Yes, because politically it is well seen,
but economically it is not necessary.
Speaking of assistance, I can give examples that I know.
Orange, according to the ZPP analysis,
in 2015-2019, for every zloty of the tax paid,
received almost 10 zlotys of public assistance.
Orange, sir, is a French company.
And it's gigantic.
That's why I say that all foreign companies are economically harmful
for the Polish economy for a long time,
but beneficial for Polish politicians.
And one day I can justify it.
But we are in the European Union, we cannot eliminate someone
because he is a foreign capital.
In the European Union, equality of rules applies.
I'm not talking about eliminating.
I'm just saying not to promote,
not to finance,
not to give incredible benefits.
Why do foreign companies have tax benefits,
as I have given, for example?
They practically do not pay any taxes.
I can give examples that this is a joke or a joke for us,
for Polish entrepreneurs.
They get public assistance from the Polish budget.
And how much did you get in your life from this public assistance?
I managed various companies and believe me,
I never got any public assistance from any company.
For decades of running, even large companies, small companies.
In my opinion, you should all create equal rules of action
and equal support or just its lack.
Let everyone deal with the market alone.
It would be fair if there were no special preferences,
tax relief, financing and so on for foreign companies,
which I claim are harmful to us.
And besides, it means that you can't compete with foreign companies,
markets, entities.
You simply have no chance.
You have no chance of competing with them.
And such an Orange or Sean will always crush Polish competitors,
because they get an incredible bonus, sir.
Well, they start from a much higher trap,
because they are big, strong companies that enter the market.
No, please forgive me, but again,
I personally, professionally, came across powerful Polish companies
that were destroyed, such as Optimus, SA, sir,
which was the largest European IT company.
Such a Polish Microsoft.
And you know what happened?
The rules were imposed on him,
and ultimately, the owner of Optimus won.
They turned out to be illegal, that's right.
Yes, yes, of course.
Mr. Roman Kluska, who now seems to be a sheep and has enough business.
Well, you know, that's how it ends for Polish companies that were successful.
Look at the business of Mr. no longer alive Gołębiowski.
A gigantic entrepreneur with great success and so on.
He is dead, he did not survive what was done to him.
The police physically murdered him.
I can say that, boldly.
So, you know, there are many examples.
One more break, we'll be back in a moment
with the topic of regulation on the energy market for entrepreneurs.
[music]

What is played, Mr. Mariusz, part 3.
Our interlocutor is Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist.
We are talking about the situation of small companies.
For a year, a very serious problem for small companies are energy prices.
Coal prices, electricity prices have increased many times.
Many businesses are closing for this reason.
He just can't survive it.
We were talking about the fact that there should be clear, clear rules on the market.
But should the energy market be regulated by the state in this case?
Or should it be left in the invisible hand of the free market?
Interesting question, because there is no clear answer to it.
First of all, the energy market is one of the strategic sectors for the state.
So it can be one of the factors that threaten the sovereignty of a given state.
So I can't imagine it not being controlled by the state in any way.
Because it is too neurological part.
Secondly, if we leave it in the hands of, let's be honest, politicians,
I don't see it either.
So I'll put it this way, it would be best if it was regulated by healthy free market rules,
but with supervision that controls the security of the state.
That's how I would put it.
And we are dealing with such control.
The state has introduced regulations on the maximum prices for people, for municipalities, for self-governments,
for so-called sensitive entities.
Should these prices be regulated also in the enterprise sector?
Or should the business simply buy at the market price?
I don't agree with these regulated prices at all.
Because that's where the evil is, in my opinion.
If you see any economic indicator, minimum wage, maximum price,
you know that something is wrong with this economy.
Because it means that healthy market rules don't work there at all.
If you look at the free market economy, if it was American, it was, because it is not anymore,
they didn't have such regulations.
You practically had free market everywhere.
There was a low fuel price there, yes, but it wasn't, as we say here,
that some maximum for some group.
No, no, no, no, the state just didn't make money on this fuel in general,
because it's great for the economy.
Low fuel prices, low energy prices, it's great.
These prices are absurd, sir.
They have nothing to do with the economic reality.
Well, yes, now they were very high.
It is known that the government earns on fuel, on excise, on cotton wool,
from which it was withdrawing from time to time.
Well, Mr. Mariusz, but it was and it is.
The war caused in Ukraine that these prices were skyrocketing in an unimaginable way.
Well, I would definitely not agree with that.
No war caused it.
This is a fact and that's it.
It's hard to even discuss it.
Suddenly we were short of 10 million tons of coal that we imported from Russia,
and which we decided not to import.
Suddenly we were offended by the supply of coal from Russia.
I mean, we used it and we're just getting out of it now.
Well, a lot has changed on this world market.
You're right.
The things I've mentioned are true, but your interpretation is not true.
Well, I'm listening.
So we stop importing, we stop receiving energy fuel on such a scale.
But this is our own decision, not related to any war.
So it didn't go up because of the war,
but because of the decisions of specific people, political decisions.
Because we are not in a state of war with Russia, as you may not know.
So I don't see any contradictions sent to the point of not keeping in touch with them.
We are at the stage of economic restrictions in relation to Russia.
But these are political decisions, sir.
Not only that, these are decisions of hypocrites.
On the one hand, sanctions are being mentioned against Russia,
and on the other hand, these sanctions are not working.
Never in any aspect.
Financial sanctions, sir, I say this as an economist,
are a concrete nonsense, it's a fake, a media fake.
Because I know at least a few Russian banks that function normally.
So we disliked a few banks, so that it looked good in the newspapers,
but those banks that are ""under sanctions""
are pushing their stuff through those that are not under sanctions.
And all the billion-dollar transactions Russia is pushing through,
just check what I'm saying, through Chinese banks.
Where are these sanctions?
Same with fuel, same with coal.
Now, just so you know, there are gigantic purchases of Putin's coal
through many countries, sir.
Do you think that what they will do with this coal?
That the miners will put it together? They will sell it to us at high prices.
But the Poles are really paying for this media hype, sir.
For these fictional pseudo-sanctions.
Right now, because of our political decisions,
the bankruptcy of companies,
massive bankruptcies of Polish companies, sir.
In a moment, when you get the data, you will say,
""Oh, it's bad."" No, it's not bad.
It's tragic, sir.
And now I also have such data,
that in some shops, half of the turnover is falling, sir.
Half! Not 10%, not 20%. 50%!
Why don't people have money, sir?
I had a case with a lady,
who worked at a cleaning company.
I talked to her for a moment.
And she said, ""Sir, I've just put on gas,
even though I know it's expensive,
that it costs money, etc.
But when they tell me that I have to pay 20,000 for coal for the heating season,
I don't have that money!""
Do you understand? I'm talking to a normal person.
This lady has been working honestly for years,
and she can't afford to buy coal.
In a country that is a potentate of coal.
It's a nightmare.
And now, we've closed most of our coal mines, sir.
And now, again, we don't want to buy coal from bad Russians, really.
What are we supposed to do? Die of hunger? Cold?
What do we gain from this, sir? That we're offended by Putin?
I understand that we can be offended by Putin,
when we have our own coal mines,
and then, okay, we don't buy anything,
we increase the production in our mines three times.
But we don't have anything to increase, because we don't have a mine!
Because we've just closed them!
And do you know how much a ton of coal from a Polish mine cost?
Before the crisis? A year ago or two years ago?
Well, within the limits of 300-400 zlotys.
Now, 3000.
No! 200-250.
Well, a tenfold difference, anyway.
I understand, sir, we pay 10 times more.
Why? Let him tell me what the reason is, because I don't know the reason.
Mr. Mariusz, it's time to finish our broadcast,
but we're already cutting to the next topic,
to the next episode,
what's happening with Polish coal,
what's happening with coal in general.
Thank you very much for today's conversation.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak,
the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation,
an economist, a financier.
Thank you, Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz? Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
financial expert, economist,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
We're talking about coal.
A year ago, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began,
coal for such an average consumer in Poland
cost around 350 zlotys per ton.
Now it costs 2,000 zlotys.
And with government support,
guarantees, subsidies,
even up to 3,500 zlotys in total,
so it was ten times higher than a year ago.
Have the costs of mining increased so much?
No, of course not.
In fact, they haven't increased at all.
Well, probably a few people got a raise,
energy costs have increased a bit.
Well, probably, but not a thousand percent.
Well, definitely not. It's obvious.
The problem is somewhere else.
But in response to the war, coal was also expensive in world stocks.
We ourselves import it, because we stopped importing coal from Russia
as the first in response to the war, as part of the sanctions.
Maybe this is the objective reason that coal is more expensive.
I don't think so.
Because Russia was our largest coal supplier,
and it was many times higher than any other contractor.
This is an absolutely obvious fact.
In addition, Russian coal was of very good quality.
It was better and cheaper, in short,
than, we are talking about opium coal, which was imported.
And what we are importing now is many times more expensive,
as you correctly indicated,
and unfortunately many times worse.
So we are importing worse and more expensive.
In the name of what?
Well, in the name of some solidarity with Ukraine,
in the name of ethics, in politics,
we just want to force Russia to stop its aggression against Ukraine with sanctions.
I completely disagree with that.
Someone who talks about ethics and at the same time does business with communist China,
which is one of the worst regimes in the world rankings,
with the largest documented level of genocide.
And there is no problem with that? Really?
Well, but China is not attacking neighboring countries yet.
They are attacking, of course they are attacking.
You just have to pay attention to the news.
For example, non-stop for many, many years there have been armed conflicts with mortals,
for example, on the border with India.
Anyway, there was such an incident recently.
Literally dozens of soldiers on both sides were fighting,
without firearms, because they have such a treaty from a certain time,
that they can fight without using modern weapons.
It sounds a bit funny, but these are the facts.
In addition, China has really been aggressive towards neighboring countries.
Military aggression, of course, is not mentioned.
I don't know why, maybe business is more important than morality.
Another thing.
Now China is openly announcing the annexation of Taiwan,
an independent country that does not want to be joined at all.
And China openly declares it and no one has the slightest problem with it.
And with this country we are developing contacts.
Moreover, we are talking about coal, and I am also talking about coal.
We import coal from China, as well as fuel.
And please note that if we stop buying all energy components from Russia,
we will actually keep buying them.
For example, from China.
Because China and Russia are one of the biggest partners.
They even signed such an agreement on unconditional friendly relations.
They are such friends to kill.
And there is a gigantic, there are special transit lines with large passages,
where, for example, Russian coal is compressed.
And Ivan, that's why this moral aspect does not speak to me at all.
Not at all.
But in that case, we should not react to war right outside our borders.
China is far away.
I don't want to justify the policy of tolerance towards China,
but China is far away, and Russia is close.
We are another country that can become an object of aggression.
Should we just keep our trade contacts with Russia and pretend that nothing is happening?
We will come back to you after the break, continuing this topic of conversation.

What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
I am Mariusz Stefaniak, a financial and economic expert,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
We are talking about coal and the international coal-mined policy.
Mr. Mariusz, what should we do?
Should we close our eyes, continue our trade contacts with Russia
and pretend that nothing is happening in Ukraine?
No, we don't have to pretend that nothing is happening.
I mean that as an economist, as a manager, I know that violent actions usually cause violent losses.
Everything can be done, but in a planned and thought-out way.
Because if someone says that suddenly the whole country can cut off, for example,
20 million tons of coal that we have brought from Russia, just like that,
then I turn my head with disbelief.
I say, it can't end well.
Because on the one hand, we are not able to fight Russia.
In fact, we are still maintaining full diplomatic contacts.
So no European country, none of our partners has declared war.
Everyone is still maintaining diplomatic contacts.
This is number one.
Moreover, everyone is trading with Russia.
And despite the loud announcements, this trade is still going on.
And even as I checked recently,
at this moment, countries are making gigantic reserves
by buying a lot of different ingredients from Russia, including coal, coal, gas.
So in a moment, we will buy the same Russian coal, but at a tenfold higher price.
Is this wise? Is this good for Poland?
But let's start with why Poland, being a power when it comes to coal,
imports coal from Russia.
Is it cheaper? Is it better?
Didn't we defend our mining market?
The answer to this is in the word ""coal"".
People don't understand that the word ""coal"" is a key word that opens many doors.
Firstly, we have two types of coal, stone and bronze.
But in fact, there are two stages of the transformation of the same organic substance, which is the ore.
Secondly, according to the Polish norm, we have 11 types of coal,
which are additionally divided depending on their use.
Energy, coke, special, including anthracite.
So what kind of coal are we talking about?
You see, because each of them has completely different parameters,
which, as I said, are very precisely defined in the Polish norm.
Because of this, they have a completely different assessment,
a completely different price and different mining conditions and mining depth, mining costs, cleaning costs.
Therefore, it is impossible to answer unambiguously.
As an engineer, I had practical classes here in the university,
related to the cast iron, furnaces, metal processing.
And one of my lecturers was the author of scientific papers on coal.
So it gave me some basis for economic analysis of this industry.
So here I immediately warn the listeners.
The use of the word ""coal"" is only such a misleading, substitutive word,
which does not show any problem at all.
But we also have different types of coal at home.
We have both brown coal and stone coal.
We are rich in coal.
Yes, it's true.
Although, for example, anthracite, which is the most valuable, the most valuable,
of all types of coal, has already been officially defined.
It was officially stated that it ceased to exist in Poland.
It was completely exploited.
For decades, the policy in the mines was, let's face it, very low level.
And it is still at a low level.
The management of Polish coal, let's face it, was terrible.
From an economic, managerial point of view.
It's just a bottomless pit.
So this Polish gold, as it is called,
is now in such a state that we got rid of the world's best quality,
practically the best quality of raw material.
Now we have different types of coal, as I said.
At the same time, the most valuable are deeply located.
Therefore, there are high costs, technically difficult to extract.
Now we have a lot of easily extractable coal,
but relatively low quality,
which, of course, also has a lot of applications and is very valuable.
So it's not like it's worth nothing.
It is worth it, but it is no longer what it was.
Not in such a low extraction costs as it was.
Generally speaking, yes, Putin's coal is better and cheaper.
That's how you could say it briefly for the listener.
What will correspond to what I said before.
Now we are bringing coal, which is actually Brea,
compared to what we took from Russia.
It is 10 times more expensive, several times worse energetically.
Because there are components that I will not bore you with,
although energy, although the content of sulfur, the content of ashes.
At this point, we just made a great show.
Basically, we will prove ourselves for this war in Ukraine,
paying horribly for it and taking something of super low quality.
And moreover, the most important thing in all this,
we still keep it official that we will close all our mines until 2049.
So we will be 100% accused of buying.
And now the question is, from whom? For how much?
And here we will put a dot, but we will come back to this interesting thread in a moment.

What is played, Mr. Mariusz?
Once again on the radio, Mariusz Stefaniak, financial expert.
Mr. Mariusz, in this case, Polish mines should now catch the wind in the sails.
Since they produced for 350 zlotys, and now they can sell several times more expensively.
For anyone who does business, this is a perfect opportunity to develop their wings.
And not so.
Because Polish mines have been closed for years.
Let's be honest, Polish mining industry structures are in a planned disappearance.
Literally.
This is how it should be and these are the plans of our rulers.
So this Hossa that took over is not something to be happy about.
Because we have nothing to be happy about.
We can only look into the future, in a few years, where we will close more mines.
We will close all mines completely and ask ourselves the question, what then?
Then we will have cheap energy behind you.
I don't think it looks like that.
Let's look at the countries that introduced it and what is happening to them after 10 years.
Mr. Mariusz, indeed, EU commitments, commitments resulting from emission restrictions,
cause that in a dozen or twenty, thirty years we will have to leave coal.
Anyway, there are reasons for this, and these are very serious, even health reasons.
Coal has a bad impact on people.
But should we completely give up coal, as it is predicted in our strategic documents?
From the point of view of the economy, absolutely not.
It is an idiotic move, it is a suicidal move in my opinion.
Because if you look at the alternatives, all of them are definitely worse, more dangerous and more harmful.
Giving up coal is not a wise thing.
Giving up fossil fuels is not a wise thing.
This is how I see it.
Okay, but we are in a situation where we are strategically obliged to eliminate coal and its combustion within 20-30 years.
And at the same time, suddenly this coal turned out to be necessary for us and we have to bring it down.
How to reconcile this?
It will be reconciled in such a way that we will fall into a gigantic economic crisis that will completely ruin our economy.
For me it is absolutely obvious and inevitable.
I omit all other aspects that cause the collapse of the Polish economy,
but the next energy factor is definitely added here.
We cut our legs in so many ways and so violently,
this is what scares me the most.
That there are such violent movements, which, you know, when you already have a sick person and you still kick him on the knees, breaking his knees,
he will not go far.
He boasted himself that he was turning me over.
This is how I see the Polish economy.
Why? Who does it and why is it doing it?
Why is the strong Polish economy seen badly?
Who is seen badly?
I think that if I look at the richest countries in the world, sir,
they are the richest and you know what?
Just about these bad, ugly fossil fuels,
which we want to consistently extort from our economic system.
Well, cheap energy is one of the important elements of economic development.
Cheap energy.
Of course yes.
And we do everything to make this energy as expensive as possible and even better from abroad.
We have no control over it at all, so if someone comes to us and says ""pay us 3000, not 300 zlotys""
and Poland will have to pay.
Now we don't have to, but we do it on our own, and that scares me, I'll be honest.
Because we don't have to do it.
I understand ideological, moral reasons and so on,
but if we wanted to act morally, we would be more consistent and we would cut off China many, many years ago.
Okay, so stop murdering people, lock yourself up in camps,
scare other countries with aggression or even attack other countries,
do all kinds of other terrible things,
then we'll go back to business.
Mr. Mariusz, but there are also health issues that cannot be underestimated.
I read estimates that in Poland, due to diseases caused by high concentration of suspended dust,
even 50,000 people die every year.
This is a fact.
Everyone who goes to the city center in the middle of winter, especially a small town,
and feels the air, feels the stench at the same time, which is caused by low emissions.
How to deal with the behavior of fossil fuels?
You know what? I also have other data.
And my data says so, sir.
A very large number of air pollution can also be related to a gigantic scourge,
which is systematically hidden and swept under the carpet,
that is, that Poland is a ""trashcan"" of Europe.
They bring us, of course illegally, but in a gigantic amount of garbage,
which are, for example, burned.
And they cause incredible air pollution,
toxic substances in the air, and we are talking about really gigantic amounts.
And this is a procedure that has been going on for many, many years.
And someone also makes gigantic money on it.
Please believe me.
And why does it last?
And why is this pollution not bad, and the pollution of coal, which is all over the world, is bad?
Please pay attention to the world statistics.
Who is the biggest pollutant in the world, sir?
There is only one answer.
China.
If you liquidate all the other countries that poison the world,
it will practically have no meaning.
China and the USA are responsible for about 90% of all pollution.
But we have great business systems with them, sir.
We develop them.
But we only destroy the economy in ourselves.
As they say, we will be sacrificed to the Pope, sir.
And because of this, our children will be starving, our companies will collapse,
and our economy will be on its knees.
Well, Mr. Mariusz, we do not yet have such a situation that children in Poland die of starvation.
And you want it to be?
Well, we are on a great path.
No, I absolutely do not want it.
I do not want it and I hope it will not be so.
But, sir, coal from PLN 300 jumps to PLN 2,000.
You do not have to be a genius and not an economist, sir, to understand what this leads to.
Do you know how many children are starved in Poland?
Today, now, as you say, they do not die.
Yes, they do not die, but there are a terrifying number of starved.
And what will happen when these effects actually multiply with a snowball?
Because now, yes, we are talking about a very bad situation, but this is just one of the symptoms.
And this is not science fiction, this is not something that will be, I do not know, for a hundred years or maybe not, no, no, no, no.
We are so close to a powerful crisis that can really lead to the death of many people.
Death by suicide, because bankruptcy leads to what?
To mass suicides, because people are not able to withstand this stress, lack of hope.
Today, now, it is already being said about the pandemic, sir, depression.
There is a drama, just.
Please check this thread, it is terrifying, and for some reason it is not on the front pages of newspapers.
And it looks terrifying, that's all I can say.
We will return to all these matters in the next edition of our hearing.
We are already inviting you together next week, next Saturday at 10.30 and Sunday at 10.30, what is played.
Mr. Mariusz, our guest is Mariusz Stefania, President of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"".
Thank you, goodbye.
See you.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
The European Commission, such information appeared in mid-January,
agreed that food producers could add flour, flour from ground home-made croutons.
For bread, for pastries, for cookies, even for pizza.
Do you think this is the future of the world or not?
I remember the era of Gierka, who launched that instead of meat we will eat an oceanic wing,
which is also a kind of scorpion.
Are we going back to this idea and abandon it or will it stay with us forever?
In my opinion, this is another revelation of the same art.
Lenin attacks.
Please note that the people behind me are the same people who are now exposed to the biggest corruption scandals,
the biggest scandals of incompetence, sexual scandals. These are exactly, physically, the same people.
These are the same elites. Nothing has changed.
But maybe we are facing the problem of food shortages in the world and hunger.
Hunger accompanies us, we try to somehow make a living from it.
Can't we feed people in the world with traditional methods?
With the data I have, I know that there is an overproduction of food in the world.
From other data I know that every moment a child dies of hunger.
Now please put these two facts together.
Well, it's a tragedy that we can't distribute this food around the world,
or we can't make it available at prices that are available to everyone.
No, it's definitely not like that.
In my studies, I had subjects like logistics, or I even gave lectures on logistics and business training.
So I have a little bit of an idea about this topic.
And I say with full conviction that we can distribute any products, including food, around the world.
We can do it very efficiently, we can plan it well, so it's definitely not an obstacle.
Well, maybe some parts of the world just can't afford high-processed and expensive food.
And that's the problem.
So maybe you can give me a part of the world that you are talking about, that is dying of hunger and can't afford it.
Well, for example, Africa is dying of hunger. Sudan.
And now, again, I invite you to the library and check where the largest deposits of valuable minerals are.
You will always end up in Africa.
These are the richest countries in the world.
Historically, I know that the countries that are now terribly destroyed, poor, are the so-called countries of the third world,
these were the countries that used to be the leaders when it comes to wealth.
You're talking about natural wealth, what's in the ground, right?
No, no, about wealth that they lived very well, they were rich, and so on.
That's what I'm talking about.
Because for a country to be poor, it really has to have one thing.
It must have very valuable natural resources, and that's the rule of poverty.
Well, it would seem that this is a rule of success, of wealth.
I'll give you an example.
You live in a town and at this point you have a rich neighbor who has a beautiful wife, a beautiful garden, a beautiful car.
So what will happen when a group of very well-armed people get close to each other?
What will happen? Let me tell you.
Well, the rich neighbor is a potential target of an attack.
Exactly. The poor one is not.
Because from the rich, you can steal a lot, from the poor, unfortunately, he will kill you, but there is no money for that.
That's the whole problem. That most countries, including Poland, which is very important, have gigantic, incredibly valuable natural resources.
We are one of the richest countries in Europe, if you didn't know.
I could exchange here, we sat here for an hour and I would exchange resources in turn, in which we are the leader.
For example, geothermal.
We have one of the best geothermal power plants in Europe, sir.
I don't know if in the world, because I don't have a map, but the maps I picked up are probably lying on the shelf somewhere.
We are the absolute leader. We are just a world phenomenon.
In many areas, especially in the areas of food production.
There are many areas that we have been and are and can be a leader, European for sure, in some parts even world.
That's why there is a problem.
But then what you said, it's better to be poor than rich.
No, it's better to be rich, sir, and strong.
And then, if you have a rich, strong neighbor, no one will attack him.
Why? Because they will attack a rich and weak neighbor.
How will it go down the street of two people with a gold necklace on their necks?
One will be a bull, the other will be a chudel.
Who will they attack, sir?
The weaker one, of course.
True. Old law of nature.
I don't know if you know, but in nature it is so that predators never attack the most fertile, tasty pieces in the herd.
Never, never, never.
Do you know who they attack?
Natural selection is that they attack the weakest victims, which are easiest to catch.
Exactly. Wounded, sick, weak, young.
We should give the listeners a moment of respite and return to our conversation in a moment.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz? Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist, a financier, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
We continue the topic of food, which we have left a little.
Mr. Mariusz, going back to food, to food and to the international situation.
The war in Ukraine, which broke out last year, suddenly threatened half of the world with hunger.
It turns out that the food produced in Ukraine is the basis for supplying, for example, North Africa.
And this country was in the eye of the storm.
Was it possible to avoid this crisis? Or is it still hanging over the world?
Of course, it is and will be.
Moreover, according to the information we have, it will be rampant.
It's so violent.
It is certainly important that Ukraine was and is one of the largest producers of grain.
And the second thing is that it's not that there is no such grain.
They have it, they have warehouses, they have large resources, so there shouldn't be a tragedy if not.
If not that they can't export it.
Because, for example, ports are blocked.
Because there are some restrictions when it comes to rail transport.
Because it's not made of rubber, it can't be extended indefinitely.
That's why it suddenly turns out that even though there is food, it won't be there.
And it's not there.
This is actually a thread and a motive that I have been observing for several years.
I read about it a long time ago, so I predicted that it would be like that.
And now it's just happening, it's happening before our eyes.
Of course, the narrative will be like that.
As it was with fuels, as with coal, etc.
There is no shortage here.
I say, of course, it's a lie.
There is food, there is fuel, there is coal, there is everything.
I call it the creation of artificial shortages.
If you limit the availability of a product that you have a lot of, but you have it under control,
then at this point you can dictate any prices.
And the war in Ukraine eliminated one of the competitors, right?
It made it difficult for him to function.
You can put your hand on it, in short.
So there is grain there.
Nothing happened to it, it didn't evaporate.
There are gigantic silos, warehouses.
That would be enough.
Of course, they certainly suffered from it.
Loot, plunders, etc.
Because they didn't achieve what they normally achieved.
This year, I assume, it will be adequately similar.
It is clear.
It's hard to sit down and collect grain when you have to fight.
Of course, let's add for the sake of order,
that it is not that Ukraine is in a war, because it is not true.
If you were to familiarize yourself with the strategic maps,
you would see that the vast majority, especially those agricultural areas,
is completely untouched by military actions.
We are talking about direct actions.
Directly, yes.
This means that the availability of labor force, for example,
for young men, etc. is significantly limited.
The availability of resources, equipment, fuel, etc.
is also to some extent, I'm not saying that it is drastically,
but it is also limited.
This is also obvious.
Many things affect the fact that these resources will be less.
This does not mean that we are talking about a crisis,
that we will not have anything to eat,
so physically, that there will be no food.
There is food and, in my opinion, according to what I know, there will be.
But it will be limited.
And here I want to give such a simple example,
that please go to any vegetable market in the center of Warsaw
and see how much a carrot costs.
Go 20 kilometers outside of Warsaw and see how much the same carrot costs.
Where does such a price jump come from?
What is it about?
This is the phenomenon I was talking about.
Local limitation of the availability of given goods
and controlling the supply of these goods.
In this way, instead of 2% of profit,
200% and most often on food,
there may be even more, 2000%.
These are gigantic price jumps.
Food producers have lowered prices,
in short, all the products you see in stores
are much cheaper.
Today, now, as we talk about it.
But the prices did not drop rapidly,
because they fell only on wholesale markets,
i.e. on the producer's markets.
In short, the intermediaries who paid x zloty
now pay 30% less.
However, in the store, on the shelves, these prices do not fall.
Why?
Because what will you go?
To milk a cow?
For the city?
No, you do not have such a method,
because there are no single cows in the villages anymore.
You will not go to the dairy and say,
""Please, a liter of milk,""
because they will not sell it to you.
That's why someone, let's call things by their names,
eats on us, on our pockets.
It was the same with fuel,
it is the same with coal,
it is the same now with food.
These are artificially created shortages.
In order to earn money.
We will come back to this very interesting economic thread in a moment.
Curious about the rest of our 8-month bike trip?
Then follow our channel.
Curious about the rest of our 8-month bike trip?
Then follow our channel.
What is played for the third time?
What is played, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier,
Foundation Więcej Mądrości.
We are returning to the topic of food.
Last year, we had the opportunity to observe
a crazy price increase in sugar in the shops.
It is quite a strange thing,
because sugar is collected once a year in the fall,
then it is processed into sugar,
which takes a few months,
and this price has no reason to increase.
And suddenly it started to increase in the shops,
even madly.
Was it a speculation,
or was it a result of the real increase in the price of production,
objective factors?
It was definitely a result of objective factors,
but not as most people assume.
Let's look at the facts.
As far as I remember,
there were about 80 sugar factories in Poland.
Now there are only a dozen left.
This shows the scale of the phenomenon.
Poland was the world's leading sugar producer
for many years during the communist era.
It was one of the most important sources of deficit for the state.
So we really were a potentate.
And believe me, there were cases
when Polish sugar was exported by wagons abroad,
Germany, to be precise,
and we bought it at a higher price.
I'm talking about whole wagons.
These are practically examples from life.
Yes, once we had 80 sugar factories,
each belonged to a different owner,
and they competed with each other.
Now we have three large companies that have divided the market.
No, there was no competition,
because, first of all,
there was a division into regions, plantations,
so no one bought the raw material from anyone.
It really wasn't like that.
It was very well organized.
Secondly, the demand for sugar was and is at such a level
that there was no big problem with the excess of sugar.
That's why I wouldn't look for any reasons there.
I would only look for the fact
that the gigantic industry,
even the standard Polish industry,
was destroyed.
This is probably the only word that comes to my mind.
And at this point,
just like with coal,
being a coal potentate,
we have to buy coal from abroad,
we also have to buy sugar from abroad,
and of course the middlemen make the most money on it,
because they wish for absurdly bad prices.
And of course, let's add to this
the impossibility of buying sugar
from a normal person,
unlike from a shop.
You won't go to a sugar factory and buy sugar,
because you won't go abroad for a kilogram of sugar,
because it's cheaper.
Because it came to the point
that you can buy the same sugar abroad,
Polish sugar, cheaper.
Do you understand?
This is a mess for me,
and we're talking about today,
today and now.
My friends sent me photos of sugar from different European countries,
from shelves with prices.
Believe me, it was cheaper than in Poland.
I mean, really?
The richest European countries have cheaper sugar,
and we, not being such a rich European country,
we are a super-debted country,
we have super-expensive sugar,
and being the largest producer of European sugar,
what's the point?
In a moment, similar problems may appear
on the pork market,
because there is a so-called ""pig's bottom"",
farmers liquidate their farms.
There may be problems with eggs.
We are waiting for an even higher price
of food items?
Definitely not.
Everything you mentioned, you mentioned very accurately.
You hit very good points.
Eggs.
We already have a problem.
It's not that we're going to have it.
We already have a problem with eggs, really.
Secondly, the destroyed production industry has been growing.
Poland was a giant again.
The destroyed Polish industry of bread production.
I will remind you of the bird flu and African wild pigs.
It's funny to me, honestly,
when you look at it from the point of view of knowledge,
it just makes me laugh.
That all the farms were knocked down.
Just like that.
And after that, the largest producers could not rise anymore.
Because rebuilding the potential,
it's not like you rebuild everything in a year.
It takes years and costs a lot.
Moreover, when you slow down,
you no longer have such a potential for sale,
other suppliers come in.
So you don't get your customers back anymore.
Just not.
So suddenly the business you had,
great working,
through a few such simple actions,
we're talking about government actions.
We're talking about legislative actions.
We're talking about preventive actions.
Well, Mr. Mariusz, but the government does not introduce an epidemic of bird flu
or African pommor.
The government is even fighting it.
You are right,
but the government imposes regulations
that cause the entire economic sectors to die.
A typical example is COVID.
The government did not introduce COVID.
Of course not.
But it introduced regulations that murdered,
literally murdered,
all areas of business activity in Poland.
Where it turned out now,
and these are already public, official, confirmed data,
that all these actions were,
first, ineffective,
secondly, illogical.
Because these are the facts.
Of course, this is not talked about when it comes to the harvest,
it is not talked about the crop,
because these were not such big topics for it to work out.
But if you dug into these topics,
you would, unfortunately, discover what I did.
The scheme is the same.
Let me remind you.
We are still talking about the same people,
about the same ruling elites,
involved in the biggest scams,
the ""catchers"", sir.
All sexual.
And we're talking about these people.
We are not talking about some great people
who are concerned about us.
No, we know by name and surname.
Of course, not all people who took the ""catchers""
are revealed.
I suspect that maybe a few percent,
maybe 1 percent.
So, everything is ahead of us.
But we are talking about such people.
They made these decisions, these laws.
And if you look at the economic side, like me,
you will see who is making money on it.
As the old Germans used to say,
""Kibono"", right?
Who makes money on it?
And then you see who is behind it.
Since we do not have our own sugar industry,
or anything else,
or the milling industry,
or the bread production,
or the coal industry,
then we have to bring it down.
From whom?
That's a good question.
And then, when you see so-called lobbyists,
people who change laws in particular countries
for money,
you have a solution.
I would like people to check it out.
We have to conclude with a sad conclusion
that anyway,
in a moment we will only have milled scorpions
and everything else will be missing.
Or a change of government.
Thank you very much for the interview.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak,
president of the ""More Wisdom"" foundation,
an economist, a financier.
Thank you.
We invite you next week.
The interview was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

[The following is a video of the European Parliament's decision to ban petrol cars]
What's the matter, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
On February 14, the European Parliament approved a directive, according to which very soon,
because by 2035 in the EU countries it will be impossible to buy and sell petrol cars.
I am personally very used to my car for petrol and I am already wondering if it can be avoided somehow.
Are we simply doomed to this decision or will we manage to avoid it somehow?
Poles will definitely find a way to do it, but my question is - why these bans?
Well, what do you mean why? So that we live in a clean, ecological world, so that it is more comfortable and better for everyone.
It sounds nice, like all communist fairy tales, but like all communist fairy tales it contains fundamentally false assumptions.
The assumption is that electric cars are ecological. It's a lie.
Well, they don't emit fuel.
Not true. They emit a lot of fuel. But not directly.
It's like your smoking stove, a terribly smoking stove, with a clever bypass, led to the neighbor's garden.
But look, I have a clean, non-emission stove. Nothing is flying out of my chimney. Pay me more. I'm a genius.
You mean energy production, right?
Not only. At practically every stage of electric car production, electric car use, electric car utilization,
we make a crushing mess of the natural environment, while stealing people from a gigantic amount of money.
Because combustion cars are well known, they are relatively easy to repair.
You can't fix an electric car yourself. You can't have a mechanic fix an electric car.
Because you need special high-voltage devices, which almost no plant has, and it's not that easy to have them.
This will practically exclude the vast majority of all people who would like to burn something in their car, repair it themselves, repair it at a low cost.
In electric cars, it's impossible. You need to have electronics, special diagnostic systems,
you can't just replace parts because it's complicated and dangerous.
It can literally physically kill you. Your diesel engine won't kill you. Unless you fall on your head.
Electric cars can burn you in the garage. Electric cars are super dangerous for users.
Super expensive to maintain for users when it comes to repair costs.
It's a bag without a bottom, in the current system. But it's just a tiny part of the problem.
A few days ago, I was listening to an interview with the director of Greenpeace Poland.
He was asked, among other things, about the limited number of combustion cars.
He answered the question that we have no other choice than to produce electric car transit in order to live healthy and safe.
Mr. Mariuszku, let's consider the ecological effects of the whole transition to electric cars.
In the full sense, it's impossible. So I'll just show you two simple mechanisms.
One is the production of batteries for electric cars, which are the most important and expensive element.
They have a total of 35 to 80% of the car's value.
And the second is the power supply of electric cars.
So I read a nice report by Swedish scientists who studied the impact of electric hybrid cars on the environment compared to combustion cars.
And, for example, the report shows that the production of lithium-ion batteries is associated with a high carbon dioxide emission.
Every 1 kWh of the battery capacity is a emission of 150-200 kg of gas.
So the bad gas, let's say.
For example, when buying a Nissan Leaf or a Tesla Model S, we have 5.3 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, 17.5 tons of carbon dioxide.
When buying a car, Swedish scientists also found that to emit as much carbon dioxide as is needed during the production of the battery,
an ordinary car would need to drive for almost 3 years, in the case of a Nissan, and in the case of a Tesla - over 8 years.
And we're only talking about the case that you buy a battery once, don't replace it, and so on.
Because when you buy a second battery, it suddenly turns out that you have to drive a regular combustion car for 16 years
to compensate for the production of the battery itself, for an electric car, for a super-eco.
I hope that helped answer the question.
Exactly. To produce a battery for an electric car, you need many, many kilograms, even tens of kilograms of rare metals.
Are we able to produce as many rare metals as possible on Earth and at what cost?
I'm an economist, so I'll answer as an economist.
If I see that some great development of the industry depends on something very difficult to achieve,
and only in a few places in the world, controlled by a few entities in the world,
then I feel a great tragedy for customers.
Because it will lead to a monopoly.
That is, there will be a few people, physically, who will control the entire industry of electric cars around the world.
Because of this, they will be able to dictate any conditions, even financial ones.
This is not a good future.
Certainly not for customers, but for producers, for suppliers.
We'll be back to our conversation in a moment.
A short break.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
As every week, our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist, a financier, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about electric cars.
We are 12 years old, to move.
Probably large companies producing cars are already moving.
My question is, Mr. Mariusz, how will this affect the manufacturers?
Currently, we have many companies producing various vehicles around the world.
Some brands are not known to us at all.
What will happen in 12 years, when only electric cars can be sold in the European Union?
Two things will happen for sure.
Actually, three things. One has already happened.
Big catches have been made.
This is absolutely obvious to me.
I have no doubt about it.
The only question is who and how much money will be given.
Because I can't imagine any other situation
where such a corrupt entity as the European Union
makes such fundamentally absurd and categorical decisions
that will be clearly and without any discussion
to the detriment of the entire population of the European Union
and to the huge benefit of a tiny group of super-rich companies.
Speaking of catches, there should be evidence that someone took them, someone gave them away.
But we have evidence of this, because the number of corruption cases,
including the names and surnames, is already overwhelming,
that in my opinion we can and should talk about it openly.
Enough of silence.
Corrupt governments, corrupt corporations, corrupt organizations.
You know, I think it's time for us to say it clearly.
These people are incompetent and greedy and they are doing us a disservice.
This whole system with electric cars will definitely steal your pocket
and push gigantic money into the pockets of producers
who will be monopolists, really, all over the world.
How can I approach it differently as an economist?
Is there any other method?
I bet that people who we know are corrupt,
who choose themselves, because they were never elected in any democratic elections,
that they have a very strange origin and very strange connections,
really very, very strange, which people don't know about again,
because they don't want to know for now,
where their great power comes from and suddenly what they deserve.
Let's go back to the topic of how the market will behave.
You said that the prospect for a lot of car mechanics, repair shops, etc. in Poland is bad.
That most of them will have to go out of business or disappear.
And what is the prospect for other manufacturers,
which will be a few, but the biggest in the world?
I didn't say anything like that.
I just meant that the whole automotive industry will change,
because electric cars are different than all the cars produced so far in the history of the world.
And that's it. And it changes the whole market system.
And we can look at it from many points of view.
From the point of view of the economy of the country, from the point of view of the household budget,
from the point of view of the environment.
And practically from each of these points of view we are on the minus.
The only plus that this system has, as I said and I keep repeating,
is for the officials who, in my opinion, take gigantic bribes,
and for the manufacturers who gain an unexpected, unfair advantage over their customers.
Because at this point, if you compare the price of an electric car with a combustion car,
the price of a combustion car is higher.
At the same time, the production process is infinitely simpler.
If you compare the number of parts in an electric and combustion car,
it will suddenly turn out that I am doing something super simple and I am taking a lot more money for it.
And besides, if you want to repair your electric car, you really have to buy a new one.
If something breaks down or you want to repair it,
you really have to spend 50-80% of the car's value on a single repair of your car battery,
which is much more expensive than super-modern, expensive combustion cars.
It's just absurd.
How long will the battery last in an electric car? 20 years? Impossible.
Apparently, it can last 10 years. But that means that cars will become very, very luxurious.
That's right. And I understand that someone is trying to make it very luxurious,
to drain money from the state budget.
These were the famous additional payments for electric cars.
It's absurd. It's a slander.
As an economist, I cry when I see such solutions,
that we introduce something that is also harmful, much worse for the consumer,
and we add to it from the state budget, i.e. once again from the consumer's money.
This is a crime.
Simply murdering the economy.
Exhausting citizens.
That's why you understand that I can't look at it any other way
than through incompetent and greedy officials,
because I can't imagine anyone, for the sake of common sense,
who is not a complete idiot, who makes such decisions.
Mr. Mariusz, it's time for a second break. We'll be back to the subject in a moment.
See you later.

This is ""Grane"", Mr. Mariusz, Mariusz Stefaniak,
finance expert, economist, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we are discussing the subject of electric cars and the changes that await us all.
There is one more question for this topic, very important.
Will we have the right amount of network energy?
At the moment, it is more or less balanced,
but if all Poles switch to several dozen or several million electric cars,
will our network withstand it?
There is no such possibility.
Even theoretically, there is the slightest chance that it would make sense.
I saw the analysis not for Poland, but for the United States,
and I saw such calculations, so due to my professional competencies,
for example, in the field of electricity,
I definitely confirm that they were absolutely right,
because it turned out that the United States,
as one of the most powerful countries in the world,
is not able to provide energy for charging electric cars
if all the plans of eco-terrorists are to be implemented.
It's just a complete ruin.
It's absolutely science fiction.
It's unfeasible.
I assume that it will be even worse in Poland,
because our network is much less invested, less developed.
I have colleagues who work in this industry,
in the right positions, and when I talk to them privately,
I hear a complaint that we are connecting another eco-suffocating source of energy,
which is actually overloading the whole network,
making it unstable,
and this only, instead of improving our energy situation,
worsens it.
In short, the more we go towards ""green"" energy,
the worse it is for energy.
We don't improve it, we spoil it.
And that's amazing.
Not only that, we spend huge amounts of money,
of course from the taxpayer's pocket, to the pocket of the chosen producers.
Whether it's wind farms or anything else,
some other senseless, ideologically justified miracles,
but not economically, not environmentally.
It's my claim that all these changes do not improve anything to the slightest degree,
they do not solve any problem,
and even if someone wanted to implement these projects,
they are impossible.
We will have to build a network of charging stations,
which will replace the current network of gas stations.
No, no, it doesn't matter.
You can build charging stations all over Poland in a year.
It's very, very difficult, but possible.
But in fact, it will only damage, and it won't help in any way,
because the charging station itself, unfortunately, does not charge anything.
The most important thing is the transmission lines,
which people don't think about at all,
they think they put a plug in a socket and it's supposed to work.
They have no idea that it's not like that.
The key here are high-voltage transmission lines,
which have not been modernized for I don't know how many years,
and there have been no new investments in it for I don't know how many years.
Such serious investments, structural investments.
In my opinion, there have been no positive, planned changes there for a long time,
because you need gigantic investments, gigantic work.
And no government is doing anything about it.
They are dealing with current affairs, not far-fetched ones.
Because no one will notice, sir, a positive change
when you invest a few billion zlotys in the reconstruction of the traction network,
that is, the transmission network.
The TV will work exactly the same way, and suddenly they will say,
""I don't see the difference, the government has nothing to boast about,
people won't vote, because suddenly...""
Who will appreciate it?
A tiny group of experts,
who have, I don't know, let's say, a few thousand in the best case scenario.
Nothing political will be built on it, you know,
no political capital will be lost, so...
No one is doing it.
They are putting any energy receivers,
and charging stations are, sir, energy receivers.
It makes no sense, because we don't have a transmission network,
we don't have an energy supply back-up,
because again, we would need to have powerful power plants,
which are able to...
I'm skipping the transmission stations, which we don't have, right?
To such a powerful energy supply.
So we are missing the two most important components, sir,
in this whole network.
What do we need from a charging station?
What do we need from electric cars?
You should watch some great videos on YouTube,
how charging stations in the US look like
around Christmas or weekends.
You have an electric car, but you won't go anywhere.
Because so many people want to charge at once,
and charging takes a few hours,
that you won't go anywhere.
So, to sum up, you are an opponent of electric cars?
No, I am an opponent of...
catchers.
And incompetent officials.
And forcing customers to do anything.
Exactly, monopolization.
Electric cars are a brilliant invention.
I drive a hybrid car myself,
and I think that introducing such hybrid solutions
should be mandatory.
For example, recovery in every car.
So, recovery of energy from braking.
A brilliant thing.
This is free energy, sir.
Not only that, it increases safety.
A lot of advantages.
Why doesn't anyone do it?
Because it would reduce fuel consumption.
Automatically, sir.
Because it would increase safety.
It would reduce the number of brake changes, for example.
Believe me, these are huge amounts of money,
that people would save.
There are a lot of such cool things.
And there are also a lot of bonuses for the user.
But these are very unpopular models,
very little produced,
and no one is going to develop it in any other way,
except for the super expensive,
exceptional models.
And when you deliver such a module,
you can deliver it to any car.
It's very easy.
It doesn't require much effort.
Brilliant solutions,
but they would be too beneficial for the customer,
and too little beneficial for the manufacturer.
So, you introduce solutions that are not beneficial for the customer,
but beneficial for the manufacturer.
But who introduces them?
An incompetent and overpriced official must introduce them,
because if there is someone who is competent,
you should never say,
""It's idiotic, we introduce something that is worse,
more expensive and has only disadvantages,
we don't want it.""
And suddenly, some envelope comes,
some gifts, and so on.
There are probably a lot of these methods.
But something that was impossible becomes possible.
Welcome to the world of democracy.
And here we should put a stop to today's episode of the series,
which is over.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist and a financier.
Goodbye.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
As every week, our guest in the radio studio is
Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom""
economist, financier.
Today we are looking at the latest
ideas, what to do with
big cities, with their development.
How to introduce restrictions, or introduce them.
Mr. Mariusz, I was worried about the information
that has been quite loud
in the media lately, about new
food rations that are prepared
in big cities. 44 grams
of meat per day
and 190 grams
of protein per day.
Quite funny rations.
Why so much? Maybe
it can be cut even more,
up to 10 grams, for example, or 20 grams of cheese
and 10 grams of meat, and also
black bread and black coffee. What do you think, Mr. Mariusz?
I was personally surprised,
and it's double. As a reader of science fiction,
I've known these concepts
for decades. For example,
in the story ""Limousine Ferriore"" by a Polish scientist
from the physics education,
and by the way, a brilliant writer, he described
all this in the style of guaranteed income,
bitcoin hard wallet,
the one we will pay
in stores for all
the luxurious things that our grandmothers
considered elementary.
Restrictions on food access for most
people and unlimited access
for rich elites. So it wasn't fiction,
but prophecy, actually.
For me, it's science fiction, and officially,
when you go to the reading room, you will see
science fiction in the department. So
I'm going to it. If someone
wants to recognize science fiction
as reality, well...
But we should
explain to our listeners who is
the author of this idea. It is a group
of the largest metropolises in the world,
the largest cities in the world,
the C40 cities, to which
Warsaw also belongs. If you
were a resident of Warsaw
and had such restrictions in the perspective
of a few or a dozen years, what would you
say to President Rafał Trzaskowski?
Nothing. The repetition of the idea from the books
of science fiction from the anti-utopia of the 80s
does not deserve a debate, in my opinion,
only a laugh. I am happy
with these ideas, because
playing chess tournament,
when I see that the opponent attacks me
in an absurdly insolent way,
it means that he will be very exposed
and if he keeps a minimum
cool head, I will easily win.
So I also look at it this way.
The more absurd ideas
will be thrown at us, the better
for us. Because if
these ideas were toned,
based on some
scientific things... Okay, fine.
And when Greta Thunberg comes out
and says that we will all die
and we are to suddenly walk in linen
shirts on the Bosak, and she herself
flies jet fighters to conferences
and gigantic yachts,
I can't take it seriously.
Especially since it has already come out,
it is no secret that all
of her pseudo-thinking
she reads from a paper. So someone
just physically controls her.
And there were such cases
where it turned out that she literally
reads it all. This is a media project.
All these things that they say, that for the good
of humanity, eco...
This is just duplication of fiction
from many decades ago.
For me, the classic
proof of this is such a sect,
American Scientology.
It was created by a physicist,
a science fiction writer. A completely average
science fiction writer. And this religion is one of the
richest in the world.
There are people like Tom Cruise, Travolta,
and hundreds of other well-known
and mega-rich people. And people
believe it. And they give it gigantic
amounts of money. And they destroy
their whole lives, and so on. So if someone
wants to believe it, please do.
But please forgive me, I will not be
in the cult of science fiction.
I am too educated, I hope,
a rational person to be able
to catch it. - Are you sure that
laughter is the best method to
simply ignore it and then it will not happen?
Well, the example you gave, Kaczu,
that such ideas are simply realized.
- Yes. What I'm talking about
may sound to you like some kind of
attention, but I know Scientology very well.
From its literal
inception until the present moment,
when people started to leave
this cult, they started to expose it.
People who were there, even in the highest
levels of power, now they just
start to show it all. How it
was, why, how it works. And they
just laugh it out. That's exactly what
we're talking about now. Scientology,
to show you the perspective, is the only
organization in the history of the world
that has overcome the US Treasury
Department. She put it on her
knees, literally. Not only that,
they also made the biggest
penetration of governments
better than the agencies of
states, etc.
Secret police, literally. It shows
that if you treat it seriously and try
to approach it seriously, it is dangerous.
But when just normal, ordinary
people, who had no power, had no
agency, they just started laughing at it
and showing absurdities, that is, as if
revealing their ""secret"" news,
then suddenly all this power of theirs
stopped having any meaning.
Now it's just pathetic, funny,
stupid.
And no one takes it seriously anymore.
And I assume that soon this
gigantic, mega sect will just
fall apart, because no one will be
treated seriously enough.
He will believe in these nonsense, fairy tales,
science fiction. So if we also
understand the basic truth,
that below a certain level, there is no discussion.
At a certain level of the meritorious,
when partners have more or less
comparable knowledge and
rationality of thinking, discussion
is the most brilliant method. But if
there is already too much
difference in knowledge
between the discussion,
the discussion stops making sense.
That's why I won't discuss with someone
drunk, drunk, intellectually
impaired, because it just
won't lead to anything.
As they say, don't argue with an idiot,
because he will lead you to your level and
will overcome the experience.
We will discuss in a moment.
We ask you to take a moment of patience.
We will be back in a moment.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
As every week, our guest in the radio studio
is Mariusz Stefaniak,
president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom""
and an economist-financial advisor.
Today we are going to talk about the latest ideas
on what to do with the big cities,
with their development.
How to introduce restrictions, or introduce them?
Mr. Mariusz, Poles have their own experience in these matters.
In the 70s we had regulations
introduced by Gierka,
we had cards introduced during the German occupation.
Maybe if it comes to it,
the inhabitants of Warsaw
will get on the train,
go to the countryside
and buy and bring illegal pigs
like during the occupation.
That's possible, of course,
because you already have illegal pigs.
There are known examples
of farmers being imprisoned
for raising their own pigs
and killing them
to eat.
Now there will be illegal ducks
and illegal hens.
They will be treated like for the occupier
because all these ideas
are based on history.
You have to read books, learn,
and then you won't be surprised.
Every occupier always tries
to limit your ability
to make decisions,
to move,
to defend, to decide about himself.
He also wants to have complete control
over all the assets of your property.
It's best if you don't have a property
because then he has all the property.
These are simple ideas
that are constantly being told
throughout the history of the world.
So if someone tries to do something
that I know what it is,
it's obvious that I won't agree.
I know one more thing.
Do you know what my favorite definition
of revolution is?
Revolution is a situation
when suddenly many people
find out that they think the same way.
An interesting definition.
And they think things that are not right-wing,
like the famous COVID.
Suddenly, what is now a scientific fact,
obvious, unassailable,
was a crime at that time.
I quote again the writers of science fiction.
""A piece of dirty cloth on your face
protects you from viruses.""
Really, people used to repeat
such things, believe in such things.
Now no respected scientist
dares to say such stupid things
because all studies have always
clearly stated it.
All these recommendations,
there were also various recommendations,
but they were, of course,
illegal, but again,
who knows the rules of the law?
That you can't limit your entry into the forest,
for example, when someone says,
""Oh, there's a magic virus and you'll die
when you go to the forest.""
It's the opposite.
It's the healthiest place you can be.
I know that education is nominal
at the moment, I know it all,
I am fully aware of it,
but we have wonderful times
when we can check almost any area of knowledge,
almost in any language.
Let's use it, we have brains,
let's use them, right?
And the fact that someone is greedy,
that someone wants to scare us,
or steal, well, it's not a surprise to me.
There have always been people
who worked and those who stole.
Returning to the issue of restrictions
in big cities, some world metropolises
already have several million people.
Managing the infrastructure of such a city
or managing the communication
between the cities that are overcrowded,
because they are huge, is a problem.
Maybe it's a solution
to reduce this problem somehow.
You know what? There's no need to...
No, no, no, because I'm always a fan
of things that work.
And I know one thing.
Regulations and top-down planning don't work.
It never worked, it doesn't work and it won't work.
It works badly.
So it doesn't work, in short.
So let's not do things that are stupid.
And we know, it's proven by the history of mankind
that it's not allowed to work.
If you were a science fiction fan,
you would know that the idea of a mega metropolis
is a classic science fiction theme.
So if someone tells me that
he will create a mega metropolis,
I know it's a science fiction concept again.
And it can't work well either.
Because, unfortunately, reality is reality
and fiction is fiction.
It will always be scattered here.
Maybe the effect of such announcements
will be that some of the residents of Warsaw
will move to Bieszczady or Puszcza Białowieska.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back again after a break.
Please wait for us.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
In the studio, Mariusz Stefaniak,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation,
financial economist.
We are talking about visions of the future, visions of big cities.
Mr. Mariusz, so how is it?
Would you run away from Warsaw
to Puszcza Białowieska to avoid
this kind of restrictions?
No, of course not.
Running away is not a solution here.
Just like I didn't run away during the COVID times.
I just knew the scientific research,
I knew my rights, I consulted with my lawyers
and that's all.
So you have to have a common sense.
Please note that there are
very few people who do such stupid things.
It's not a problem for Hitler,
it's not a problem for Stalin,
it's not a problem for Mao,
it's not a problem for any other
lunatic or murderer.
The problem is
that we agree on it.
There is no greater obstacle,
if someone would go out
in the right amount of people
and say ""ok, let's fall"".
The biggest regime, the most brutal,
that is Chinese,
bent his knee, because suddenly
the Chinese, let's add that they are more defenseless,
because in China it is even worse than in Poland
when it comes to the possibility of defending themselves.
There it is a total, completely
driving disarmament to an absurd level.
And they went out on the street
and the Chinese army, being one of the most powerful
armies in the world,
was unable to do anything about it.
And what did they do? They repealed all the COVID restrictions
in all of China, in a few days.
Where for the last few years
they kept people like animals in cages.
When you were shopping, and some person,
one person in the whole market
came out for some magical reasons
that he has this red cat,
at that moment they wrapped you
with a cordon, they fenced everything,
they caught you like animals in a cage
or like a catch for Hitler.
They put you in a series of such containers
with cages where you had one
window and they kept you there.
Or they physically welded you
at home, welding windows
and doors with iron rods,
which led to many deaths.
The famous story that led to these riots
that the whole family died,
they burned alive, because
of the welded doors and chains
put on the staircases
during the power plant accident
the whole skyscraper started to burn
and people could not escape, they burned alive.
And that caused huge protests
in the whole China. And suddenly it turned out
that after a few years of brutal lockdowns
suddenly everything was taken down.
Because the Chinese went out
on the street totally unarmed.
Do you understand? This is how it works.
There are billions of Chinese, you know,
you have to count on such power.
No, it doesn't matter.
In Germany, how many Germans were there during the war,
and how many so-called Nazis were there,
that is, Germans,
who believed in Hitler's ideology.
It is never the case
that you have more thieves in the village than
people robbed. Never. It is impossible.
In short, you can
take a few guys from the area
and pacify all the thieves in an hour.
And you will have 0.0 thefts.
Just completely zero.
Non-existent crimes.
Because there are always few of them.
How many thieves, bandits, murderers
do you have in such a city of several million?
In such a metropolis?
A handful. Literally a handful.
So if normal people
would go, they would simply
be forced to put
only these scarves on them.
Do you understand? All bandits and murderers.
That's why I was talking about this revolution.
If you realize what a gigantic force
ordinary people have,
you will understand
that we have nothing to be afraid of.
We can laugh at the ideas of idiots,
at the ideas of some criminal regimes,
at the ideas of those who want to keep
causing wars and earn money on them, of course.
Suddenly you will say - give up!
And what will you do to us?
We will not do anything to you.
Even the most brutal regimes are not able to do anything.
These are the facts.
We live by the rules of democracy.
We do not have to make a revolution.
It is enough to use our voices
in the next elections.
And we will probably find out
which groups are losing, which are gaining.
I am returning to the topic of cities of the C40 group.
One of the ideas that are launched,
maybe not so well-launched,
is that Warsaw has already committed
to creating zones in 2030.
And these are quite large zones
that will be excluded from the movement of combustion vehicles.
So this is another example
that people will simply agree to such solutions.
Maybe necessary, maybe not.
But they are slowly being introduced.
Yes, they are introduced, they are popular,
they are solutions.
In many cities where I have been, in various countries,
they have introduced it.
Only it is certainly not so simple, zero-one.
Because this is an example of a situation
that has certain rational aspects,
a lot of irrational,
let's be honest,
ideological aspects,
not supported by anything at all.
We are finishing our conversation today.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist and financier.
At the end, we want to give you
the phone number of the automatic secretary.
We ask you to record
with information
what you think about our hearing,
what you would like to hear,
what questions
we should ask our expert.
Please call the number
536-286-286.
Once again,
536-286-286.
See you next week.
Goodbye, Mr. Mariusz.
Goodbye.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
financial expert, economist, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
We're talking about coal and international coal-mined politics.
A year ago, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began,
coal for an average Polish consumer cost around 350 PLN per ton.
Now it costs 2,000 PLN.
And with government support, guarantees, and additional payments,
it was even 3,500 PLN in total,
which is ten times higher than a year ago.
Have the costs of mining increased so much?
No, of course not.
In fact, they haven't increased at all.
Probably, people got a little raise, energy costs increased a little.
There's probably something there, but not a thousand percent.
Well, definitely not.
This is obvious.
The problem lies somewhere else.
But in response to the war, coal has also increased in world stocks.
We ourselves are importing it,
because we stopped importing coal from Russia as the first in response to the war,
as part of the sanctions.
Maybe this is the objective reason that coal is more expensive.
I don't think so.
Because Russia was our biggest coal supplier,
and it was many times higher than any other contractor.
This is an absolutely obvious fact.
In addition, Russian coal was of very good quality.
It was better and cheaper, in short,
than the coal that was imported.
And what we are importing now is many times more expensive,
as you correctly indicated,
and unfortunately, many times worse.
So we are importing worse and more expensive.
In the name of what?
In the name of some solidarity with Ukraine,
or in the name of ethics in politics,
we want to force Russia to stop its aggression against Ukraine with sanctions.
I completely disagree with that.
Someone who talks about ethics and at the same time does business with communist China,
which is one of the worst regimes in the world rankings,
with the highest documented level of genocide.
And there is no problem with that? Really?
But China does not attack neighboring countries yet.
At least not so far.
They do attack, of course.
You just have to pay attention to the news.
For example, non-stop for many, many years,
there have been armed conflicts with mortals,
for example, on the border with India.
Anyway, there was such an incident recently.
Literally dozens of soldiers on both sides were fighting without firearms,
because they have such a treaty from a certain time,
that they can fight without modern weapons.
It sounds a bit funny to me, but these are the facts.
In addition, China has really carried out aggression against neighboring countries.
Military aggression, of course, is not mentioned.
I don't know why. Maybe business is more important than morality.
Another thing.
Now China is openly announcing the annexation of Taiwan,
an independent country that does not want to be joined at all.
And China openly declares it.
And no one has the slightest problem with that.
And with this country we are developing contacts.
Not only that. We are talking about coal.
And I'm talking about coal too.
We import coal from China.
The same with fuel.
And just pay attention,
that if we stop buying all energy components from Russia,
we will actually keep buying them.
For example, from China.
Because China and Russia are one of the biggest partners.
They even signed such an agreement on unconditional friendly relations.
They are such friends to kill.
And there is a gigantic,
there are special transit lines with large passages,
where, for example, Russian coal is compressed.
And that's why this moral aspect does not speak to me at all.
At all. Totally. At all.
But in that case, we should not react to war right outside our borders.
China is far away.
I don't want to justify tolerance policies towards China,
but China is far away, and Russia is close.
We are another country that can become an object of aggression.
We should just keep our trade contacts with Russia and pretend that nothing is happening.
We will come back to you after the break, continuing this topic of conversation.

What's up Mr. Mariusz? Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
a financial expert, an economist, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
We are talking about coal and international coal-mined politics.
Mr. Mariusz, what should we do?
Should we close our eyes, continue our trade contacts with Russia and pretend that nothing is happening in Ukraine?
No, we don't have to pretend that nothing is happening.
I mean that as an economist, as a manager, I know that violent movements usually cause violent losses.
You can do everything, but in a planned, thoughtful way.
Because if someone says that suddenly the whole country can cut off, for example, 20 million tons of coal that we have brought from Russia,
just like that, then I turn my head in disbelief.
I say, it can't end well.
Because on the one hand, we are not in a state of war with Russia.
In fact, we are still maintaining full diplomatic contacts.
So no European country, none of our partners has spoken out of war.
Everyone is still maintaining diplomatic contacts.
This is number one.
Moreover, everyone is trading with Russia and despite the loud announcements, this trade is still going on.
And even as I checked recently, at this point, countries are making gigantic reserves,
simply buying a lot of different components of products from Russia, including coal, coal, gas.
So in a moment we will buy the same Russian coal, only at a tenfold higher price.
Is this wise? Is this good for Poland?
But let's start with why Poland, being a power when it comes to coal, imports coal from Russia.
Is it cheaper? Is it better? Didn't we defend our mining market?
The answer to this is in the word ""coal"".
People do not understand that the word ""coal"" is a key word that opens many doors.
First, we have two types of coal, stone and bronze.
But in fact, there are two stages of the transformation of the same organic substance, which is the TOR.
Secondly, according to the Polish norm, we have 11 types of coal,
which are additionally divided, depending on the application, into energy, coke, special, in which anthracite is released.
So what kind of coal are we talking about?
I understand, because each of them has completely different parameters, which, as I said, are very precisely defined in the Polish norm.
Because of this, they have a completely different application, a completely different price and different mining conditions and mining depth, mining costs, cleaning costs.
Therefore, it is impossible to answer unambiguously.
As an engineer, I had classes here in the studies, and I even had practical classes related to the casting of furnaces, metalworking.
And one of my lecturers was the author of scientific papers on coal.
So it gave me some basis for economic analysis of this industry.
So here I immediately warn the listeners.
The use of the word ""coal"" is just such a misleading, substitutive word that does not show any problem at all.
But we also have different types of coal at home. We have both brown and stone coal. We are rich in coal.
Yes, it's true. Although, for example, anthracite, which is the most valuable, the most valuable of all types of coal, has already been officially defined.
It was simply officially stated that it ceased to occur in Poland. It was completely exploited.
For decades, the policy in the mines has been, let's face it, very low. And it is still at a low level.
The management of Polish coal, let's face it, was terrible.
From the point of view of the economic, managerial, it's just despair.
So this Polish gold, as it is called, is now in such a state that we got rid of the world's best quality, practically the best quality of raw material at low prices.
Now we have different types of coal, as I said.
However, the most valuable are deeply located, which is why the costs are high, technically difficult to extract.
Now we have a lot of easily extractable coal, but relatively low quality, which, of course, is also in mass use and is very valuable.
So it's not that it's not worth anything. It is worth it, but it is no longer what it was, not in such a low extraction costs as it was.
In general, then, coal from Putin is better and cheaper.
That's how you could say it briefly for the listener.
What will correspond to what I said earlier.
Now we extract coal, which is actually Bray compared to what we took from Russia.
It is 10 times more expensive, several times worse energetically, because there are reactors there, which I will not bore you with, at least energy, although the content of sulfur, the content of ashes.
At this point, we just made a great show, basically, we will show ourselves for this war in Ukraine, paying for it horrendously and taking something of super low quality.
And moreover, the most important thing in all of this, we still keep it official that we will close all our mines by 2049, so we will be 100% accused of buying.
And now the question is, from whom? For how much?
And here we will put a dot, but we will come back to this interesting thread in a moment.
We are going to the mine.
The mine of the ""Bray""
The mine of the ""Bray""
What is played, Mr. Mariusz, once again on the antenna, Mariusz Stefaniak, financial expert, Mr. Mariusz.
In this case, Polish mines should now catch the wind in the sails, since they produced for 350 zlotys, and now they can sell several times more expensive,
for everyone who does business, this is a perfect opportunity to develop the wings.
And it is not, because Polish mines are intentionally closed for years. Let's be honest, Polish mining industry structures are in a planned disappearance.
Literally, this is how it should be and these are the plans of our rulers.
So this ""Hossa"" that prevailed is not something to be happy about, because we have nothing to be happy about.
We can only look into the future, in a few years, where we will close more mines, completely close all mines, and ask ourselves the question, what then?
Then we will have cheap energy behind the tome.
It probably doesn't look like that. Let's look at the countries that introduced it and what is happening to them after 10 years.
Mr. Mariusz, of course, EU commitments, commitments resulting from the restrictions of emissions, cause that in a few years or in 20-30 years we will have to leave coal.
Anyway, there are reasons for this, and these are very serious, even health reasons. Coal has a bad impact on people.
But should we completely give up coal, as it is predicted in our strategic documents?
From the point of view of the economy, absolutely not. It is an idiotic move, it is a suicidal move in my opinion, because if you look at the alternatives, all the alternatives are definitely worse, more dangerous and more harmful.
Giving up coal is not a wise thing, giving up fossil fuels is not a wise thing. This is how I see it.
Okay, but we are in a situation where we are strategically obliged to eliminate coal and its combustion within 20-30 years, and at the same time, suddenly, this coal turned out to be unnecessary for us and we have to bring it down. How to reconcile this?
It will be reconciled in such a way that we will fall into a gigantic economic crisis that will completely ruin our economy.
For me, this is absolutely obvious and inevitable. I omit all the other aspects that cause the collapse of the Polish economy, but the next energy factor is definitely added here.
I cut my legs so much, so violently, that's what scares me the most.
That these are such violent movements, that you know, when you already have a sick person and you still kick him on the knees, breaking his knees, he won't go far.
You see, he was boasting himself, you see, and he was turning it over. This is how I see the Polish economy. Why? Who does it and why?
Why is the Polish strong economy seen badly? Who is it seen badly by?
Because I think that if I look at the richest countries in the world, they are the richest, and you know what they are based on?
Exactly on these bad, ugly fossil fuels, which we so consistently want to extort from our economic system.
Cheap energy is one of the important elements of economic development.
Of course, yes. And we do everything to make this energy as expensive as possible and even better from abroad.
We have no control over it at all, so whatever comes, someone will tell us to pay 3000, not 300 PLN and Poland will have to pay.
Now we don't have to, but we do it ourselves at our own risk. And that scares me, I'll be honest, because we don't have to do it.
I understand the ideological, moral aspects and so on, but if we wanted to act morally, we would be more consistent and we would cut off China many, many years ago.
Okay, so stop murdering people, lock yourself up in camps, scare other countries with aggression or even attack other countries, do other terrible things, then we'll get back to business.
Mr. Mariusz, but there are also health issues that cannot be underestimated.
I read estimates that in Poland, due to diseases caused by high concentration of suspended dust, even 50,000 people die every year.
This is a fact, everyone who goes to the city center in the middle of winter, especially a small town, and feels the air,
he also feels the stench that is caused by low emissions. How to deal with the behavior of carbon dioxide?
You know what? I also have other data. And my data say so, sir.
A very large number of pollution in the air can also be related to a gigantic sphere that is systematically hidden and swept under the carpet,
that is, that Poland is a ""trashcan"" of Europe.
They bring to us, of course illegally, but in a gigantic amount of garbage that is, for example, burned.
And they cause incredible air pollution, toxic air substances, and we are talking about really gigantic amounts.
And this is a procedure that has been going on for many, many years. And someone makes gigantic money on it, too. Please believe me.
And why does it last? And why is this pollution not bad, and the pollution of coal, which is all over the world, is bad?
Please pay attention to the world statistics. Who is the biggest pollutant in the world, sir?
The answer is only one. China. If you liquidated all the other countries that pollute the world, it would practically make no difference.
China and the USA are actually responsible for about 90% of all pollution.
But we have great business plans with them, sir. We develop them. But we only destroy the economy in ourselves.
As the saying goes, we will be ""sacred from the Pope"", sir. And because of this, our children will be hungry, our companies will fall, and our economy will be on its knees.
Well, Mr. Mariusz, we do not yet have such a situation that in Poland children die of hunger.
And do you want it to be? Well, we are on the right track.
Well, no, I absolutely do not want it. I do not want it and I hope it will not be so.
But, sir, coal from PLN 300 jumps to PLN 2000. You do not have to be a genius and not an economist, sir, to understand what this leads to.
Do you know how many children are undernourished in Poland? Today, now, as you say, they do not die.
Yes, they do not die, but there are a terrifying number of undernourished.
And what will happen when these effects actually multiply with a snowball?
Because now, yes, we are talking about a very bad situation, but this is just one of the symptoms.
And this is not science fiction, this is not something that will be, I do not know, in a hundred years or maybe not, no, no, no, no.
We are so close to a powerful crisis that can really lead to the death of many people.
Death by suicide, because bankruptcy leads to what? To mass suicides.
Well, because people are not able to withstand this stress, lack of hope.
Today, now, it is already said about the pandemic, sir, depression. There is a drama, just.
Let you check this thread. It is terrifying, and for some reason it is not on the front pages of newspapers.
And it looks terrifying. That's all I can say.
We will return to all these matters in the next issue of our hearing.
We are already inviting you together next week, next Saturday at 10.30 and Sunday at 10.30, what is played.
Mr. Mariusz, our guest is Mariusz Stefania.
Finally, we want to give you the phone number of the automatic secretary. We ask you to record with information.
What do you think about our hearing? What would you like to hear? What questions should we ask our expert?
Please call the number 536-286-286. Once again, 536-286-286.
See you next week. See you, Mr. Mariusz.
Thank you. Goodbye.

What's up Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up Mr. Mariusz?
Today we are talking about banks and that some of them have stood on the edge of financial abyss.
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"".
Mr. Mariusz, the American bank Silicon Valley has fallen.
The Swiss bank Credit Suisse stood on the edge of bankruptcy a few days ago,
but recently it was saved by a huge loan from the National Bank of Switzerland.
I wonder how many customers have to come to the bank or pay their money online for the bank to go bankrupt.
There are several reasons for bank falls.
One of them, of course, you mentioned.
Yes, you can destroy any big bank in one day, when some customers will come for their money.
Because banks don't have our money anyway.
How much do they actually have what they should have?
Once they had literally everything.
So their profits were relatively small.
I mean, they were big as they were at that time, but in the current system, the bankers laughed at them.
That they are poor.
Because actually only their capital was counting profits.
And now they have to have only a few percent.
For example, in Poland it was recently 2%.
How many?
Two.
Currently it has been raised to 3.5%, which shows how dramatic the situation is in Poland.
It is the so-called ""stop of the reserve"".
And it is the more the greater the risk.
At least we are talking about the current, modern policy of central banks.
For example, if a bank customer's account has a 100 zlotys,
the bank must have only 1 or 2 zlotys in its assets at 1% or 2%.
That's all.
It doesn't have to have anything more.
I know it sounds crazy, but that's the reality.
In general, the ""stop of the reserve"" is something amazing.
It is one of the most important factors shaping the economy of the whole country.
Nominally, it is supposed to secure deposits.
So when you put money in, it is supposed to secure it.
But let's face it, securing 2-3% of your assets is not securing, to be honest.
Mr. Mariusz, as far as I know, at the beginning of the pandemic,
there was already a situation where people were massively sending cash to ATMs.
There was a share of the distribution of additional printed money.
And they managed to stop it somehow.
There was no special panic, at least.
The actions of the National Bank of Poland turned out to be somehow effective.
Yes, but it was nothing serious, to be honest.
There were much more serious situations, which few people know about,
except for a group of bankers or economists like me.
And we were on the verge of a total economic collapse.
But you mentioned one reason.
Did we talk about one reason for the bank's collapse?
What are the potential other reasons?
For example, the super-well-known ones.
One of the largest and oldest banks in the UK
collapsed due to one single employee,
who was playing on so-called ""term contracts"".
For people who have no idea about finances, economy, banking or the stock exchange,
it's like you went to the casino, bet 10 tokens and could win 100 tokens.
If you bet well, if not, you lose 10.
And that's how you play, right?
This is betting, for example, on the exchange rate of various currencies or various events,
for example, the price of goods in the future.
So you bet that the grain will be 10,000 or, I don't know, the coal will be $1,000 per barrel in July this year, for example.
And you bet on such a bet.
If you hit, you are mega-rich.
One person, one single employee,
and I'm not saying the highest-ranking, because I'm not a president,
an extraordinary senior employee,
laid one of the most powerful, oldest banks.
The second situation is when the bank gives so-called ""bad loans"", ""difficult loans"".
There are such departments in the bank.
This means that the bank gives loans that will never be paid.
For many reasons this is happening.
One of them, which is very well confirmed, documented and is coming out more and more,
are criminal, mafia systems.
So the mafia has a large share of banking.
And with the help of the most often bribed, frightened, or at the same time frightened and bribed people from the bank,
he makes conclusions that are of course accepted in the dark.
And it is known that these are for so-called ""pillars"",
or people who are homeless, or for personal, stolen, or officially created evidence.
Credit is taken, most often for large sums of money,
for companies that are total scammers,
who have never had any property, and so on and so on and so on.
Well, for real estate without value, we know it, we even know it from our area.
Yes, or non-existent, even real estate, is exactly right.
So it can be such a policy.
We can have an example, like in the United States in 2008,
that is, the bankruptcy of this real estate bank.
So then it was also a systemic mistake,
that is, banks invested in seemingly safe papers.
So it was about those papers related to real estate,
that is, considered one of the safest.
Which, of course, as it turned out, it was fiction, it was a fairy tale, it was a lie.
And then they put a lot of money into it,
and at the moment when the market was falling,
well, suddenly the assets in the bank disappeared,
because suddenly it turned out, but we had 100 billion dollars there,
and now it's worth 1 billion dollars, right?
And that's literally for hours or days.
So then the bank lost the so-called financial liquidity,
that is, the ability to regulate its obligations.
And there are two options.
Option ""either we close such a bank"",
because you don't have money to pay employees,
for energy, for garbage, and so on.
Well, what are you doing? You close the company, right?
Or, which is unfortunately more common in banking,
because these are such big, loud matters.
Exactly, but we will go into this topic after the break,
because you have to take a little break.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Today we are talking about banks
and that some of them have stood
on the edge of a financial abyss.
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier,
president of the ""More Wisdom"" Foundation.
Mr. Mariusz, I wonder how this is possible at all.
We have a extensive financial supervision,
warranty funds.
It would seem that the bank's fall
in such a legal situation
should be impossible.
It is exactly the opposite.
It is precisely this whole system
of not only the bank's fall,
but also the whole financial crash,
the fall of the entire economy.
Because, as we have already said,
we have revealed the truth,
banks do not have the money
they should have to be profitable.
They can create money literally from scratch,
that is, you pay a zloty,
they can give themselves a loan
for 98 zlotys.
They just don't have to have a cover in it.
So they can create money,
earn money
that they don't even have.
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's the reality of modern banking.
Why does it work?
Because the governments agree to it.
Not only do they agree,
they actively create it.
Because it's really the governments
who say how much percent.
If the governments said,
""Okay, you have 98% coverage,""
but the governments reduce it.
Unless there are some dramatic situations,
then even such a government will say,
""But it's 3.5%!""
""Wow, we saved the economy!""
No, you just increased the margin
between the gap and the road.
And that's a few centimeters.
That's all, but you didn't make sure
that the road was safe.
The whole system of modern economy
is devoid of free market rules.
Because it's really like
you're playing cards
and when you lose,
you have to pay 2%
of what you lost,
and when you win,
you take 100% from the others.
And you play like this,
over and over again.
Can you lose?
Mr. Marysz, the system is designed
to protect the investments of ordinary people.
At least that's the rule.
Last year, something strange happened
to the Polish businessman's bank,
Leszek Czarnecki,
which is GetInNobelBank,
which probably actually collapsed.
Because that's what it's called.
The number of clients has not changed much.
The accounts, the ATMs, etc.
still work.
But what does this forced restructuring
actually mean?
I don't know if you know,
but you just said the biggest threat
to Polish banking and the entire Polish economy
since the war.
We're talking about a whole package
of financial entities.
GetInHolding, GetNobelBank,
MV Trade, Open Finance, Idea Bank.
Let's add that Mr. Leszek was an agent
of the biggest communist and post-communist countries.
For example, Idea Bank Ukraine, Idea Bank Belarus,
Idea Bank Romania, Idea Bank Russia.
If someone is a business person in these places
and still lives,
as they say, and even gets rich,
the conclusions are obvious to me.
He must have some incredible
background, having influence,
let's say, openly, in a mafia connection
of post-communist services
with every major business.
You mentioned these problems
with the entire capital group,
and I think they understand
that it's impossible to talk about the problems
of one bank in the current economic system.
Imagine a situation
where you have, to make it easier,
let's say, 10 banks.
You are a central bank, you have 10 banks.
Each of them pays you 2% of the reserves.
Let's say that one of these banks
becomes unprofitable
due to its actions.
What happens? You have to guarantee,
because there are such guarantees,
there are certain regulations,
that this fund is to give back
100% of the money, and above that,
unfortunately, no more.
If you calculate the money you have to give back,
it turns out that you have to
add to this business.
And now what happens? You have to collect this money from where?
You don't have money yourself.
So you take the money you paid
to the other 9 banks,
and you have to transfer this money to people.
At this point, the credibility of the entire
banking sector is at risk.
And the whole state,
guarantees this money
to certain traps.
But what will happen if you
don't have this money to cover?
At this point, other banks
have to give up.
But these banks, as we said, don't have this money.
So it may suddenly turn out that
where we raise some obligations
for other banks, banks will no longer be able
to meet them. And what happens then?
Another bank has financial problems,
so you have to cover again the deposits
of those people you have committed to cover.
Depends on which bank has which deposits.
But let's say it's 100,000.
To this extent, you have an obligation to pay.
Okay. But suddenly,
this money is gone. And there is not so much of it.
I imagine that the fall of one bank
can still be amortized somehow,
but the second one is probably already ...
No, no, no, no. Exactly
in the case of this Czarnecki empire,
it was what those amounts were
there that made
Poland not have such money.
We couldn't afford
the fall of these banks, to put it brutally.
It wasn't like that. These banks fell
and suddenly Mr. Czarnecki said,
""Okay, I don't have money, I'm closing the banks.
You can take over the obligations now.
Thank you. I'm done.
I'm an entrepreneur. Okay, I didn't make it.
And at this point, you know who has a problem?
Not Mr. Czarnecki. Because he is rich,
he will be rich, he has earned so much money
and probably led somewhere on the Sheshels,
Bahamas, Cyprus or the Caymans.
And he will manage to the end of his life
and his children's children too. Who will have a problem?
Central Bank, the whole country.
We would, as a whole country,
simply count total bankruptcy
because of a tiny bank.
Because this is how this system
is designed,
this is how it is deprived of financial liquidity,
to put it professionally,
that even the slightest hesitation
of a small bank
can destroy the whole system.
It is so sensitive, sir. It is so dangerous.
Mr. Mariusz, the second break.
We'll be back in a moment.
The end of the first part.
The end of the second part.
The end of the third part.
The end of the fourth part.
The end of the fifth part.
The end of the sixth part.
The end of the eighth part.
The end of the ninth part.
The end of the tenth part.
The end of the eleventh part.
The end of the twelfth part.
The end of the twelfth part.
The end of the twelfth part.
The end of the twelfth part.
The end of the twelfth part.
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier.
We're talking about banks and whether they can fall.
When can they fall?
Mr. Mariusz, you said that the system is in danger.
And I thought that these guarantees,
these restructurations,
it's all to protect
the savings of us, ordinary citizens.
I don't think it's true.
At least judging by the regulations,
judging by the practice in the entire financial sector.
If you think about it,
what do all financial companies live on?
And what do all governments live on?
From citizens' money.
They have no other option.
The bank doesn't create anything, sir.
The bank itself can't generate anything.
It can't produce anything.
It can only live on your money.
It's like a slingshot.
It can only pull money from you and get stuck.
The bank can't produce any product.
They call it bank products,
but it's actually a scam.
It's not a product.
It produces money.
Yes, it's exactly like ""give me your money,
I'll give you a share and we'll live like this"".
It's such a system.
Of course, I'm not saying that
none of the bank instruments make any sense.
They make sense, but the point is
that in this system,
which we see today,
the boundaries of duties and rights
towards one entity
have been so abnormally
shifted,
that we're practically
talking about a form of coercion.
For example, you have a company
and at this point you don't have the right
not to have a bank account.
And now, if the bank says you're entitled to an account,
you have to pay for it.
Why? Because you have a duty to do it.
If they tell you a million dollars a month,
you'll pay a million dollars a month.
The fact that they say some amount,
what does it result from?
From the agreements with the governments.
The government says, ""Okay, do it this way,
so that people don't rebel.""
The famous Belkid tax.
Suddenly they said, ""Okay, we'll take
your savings, which you have earned
with your capital,
which we're taking a part of anyway,
and we'll take extra money from you.
Because we can. Extra payments for cards,
for terminals, for non-terminal
some kind of reporting, I don't know, theft,
for absurd things.""
And these fines came to absurd amounts at some point.
Of course, when the matter becomes
too loud, too difficult,
I regulate it quickly to calm the sheep
and to make them not to be too stubborn.
Banks and governments live only
from money.
Customers can get angry,
transfer their savings from one bank to another,
transfer their account.
For example, the bank we were talking about,
Getinobl Bank, for years had a lot of customers
because it gave good interest,
higher profits from bank premises.
In that case, is such a bank policy,
which attracts premises,
giving higher interest,
shouldn't it be a warning light
for customers that something is going on
with this bank?
Of course not. I myself personally worked
in a bank that was the first in Poland
to do a share of high interest rates.
It was a legendary figure,
it was founded, then it was literally
- I assume I can say this,
because I had such a task in the bank -
by the authority commissioned,
that I prepared some documents there,
some emission of securities.
And that's why I had an insight
into the facts related to the seizure.
Well, that's what we say, the seizure,
that is, the real seizure of a private bank
by the state.
In fact, we'll take your bank.
What will you do to us?
And literally, when I looked at it,
is it really so? Is it possible?
Okay, you can, of course, everything is possible.
Because actually, who decides what is possible?
Government and banks.
You have nothing to say.
You go for a loan, they give you a document,
you can't go to anyone else,
because all banks are, you can say,
even in a form of a contract, yes?
We have set rules.
These rules are set by the central bank,
which is the boss of all bosses.
And he sets these rules.
You have nowhere to go. You have nowhere to run.
You don't have a free market,
that banks compete with each other,
give you better conditions, worse.
The differences are small, anyway.
There are none. It is so symbolic
to give you a feeling that, okay,
I told you, you can decide which bank I will invest you in.
You have such decisions only in banking.
Because you don't influence any forms of payment,
security, security.
They will say, okay,
put your NERK, because we won't give you a loan
for the operation, and you will leave it.
You have no choice.
When people realize that they don't really
rule with their money,
because it's not their money,
the moment the bank puts its hand on it,
when you bring your money to the bank,
they stop being your money,
they stop paying you. I was talking about Cyprus.
Suddenly the banking sector said,
okay, but we will pay you only this part of the money,
and we won't pay you the rest,
and additionally we will tax you.
Because we can.
We see such things every now and then.
Of course, we pretend that we don't see it,
because we would have to ask ourselves,
but it's sick, it's dangerous, what am I doing?
The power is shifted only in one hand,
and you as a client, only someone who really
brings real money, you have nothing to talk about.
The only decision you still have,
in a certain range, is that you may not bring
this money, but it will be over soon.
Now you can still take some banknotes,
banknotes from your wallet,
take them home, take them out of the bank,
or pay for them to the bank, you can.
But at the moment, you won't even be able to do that.
So maybe it's worth considering
some actions,
while you can still do something.
And this is probably the best summary
of our today's hearing.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest every week is the economist, financier, Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we have the housing market on the wallpaper and our predictions from 9 months ago.
I came back to our conversation published in July last year on the pages of the ""Nowa Trybuna o Polskiej"".
Well, 9 months have passed, actually a burden.
Your predictions about the situation on the real estate market have been true.
It's bad, we all know that.
The construction of housing estates, housing loans is less and less, it will be 30% of what was taken a year ago.
However, there is no panic sale of real estate and there are no waves of consumer losses.
The first question is probably essential. Do we still have it in front of us?
Everything I said then is fully supported.
Some, as you rightly noticed, have already happened, there will be more.
Let's add, maybe to explain, that your interview was completely unique,
because other newspapers were putting in an endless housing boom and were foretelling further profits and encouraged speculation.
You were a few journalists who warned that there was a breakdown.
Well, you warned, I just asked.
But it was your interview, you published it, you raised the topic.
Others preferred to shout how great it will be, what the housing market is, that the housing prices will go up, that there is development here, etc.
You said a very interesting thing in your interview, that people, when making financial and economic decisions, do not direct themselves with reason, but with emotions.
9 months ago, everyone said that it would be perfect, because there was still euphoria on the market.
How would you describe social moods now, and moods when it comes to the economy and the future?
I would call it a surprise.
It's like your beloved girl suddenly gives you a kiss in place of another kiss.
You are still smiling, but the smile is fading on your lips, because you feel a burning cheek.
Well, a slight pain, but you know that something has just ended.
What will happen next?
Then there will be a shock when you find out that she was sleeping with your boss all the time.
A kiss was a trick to get money from you and meet a richer man than you.
Then there will be a breakdown when you come to your sense of scale of what happened and you will learn the word ""food"".
I see such a scenario, and it's not just that the market itself will break down, but that we will pay for its breakdown.
And those who caused it will count the next profits, because they were gaining profits all the time, and people were only living in poverty.
A very interesting comparison. Who is this girl? Please tell us everything.
This is the housing market.
You buy a house for 2000 PLN, and it will be worth 400 PLN.
You buy it for 400 PLN, it will probably be worth 800 PLN.
So people fell in love with an unknown girl, because how many people who bought a house speculated really know about it.
They know about real estate, they know about finances, they know about the economy.
People threw themselves, who had no idea about it at all.
People were entering 30-year loans without any economic grounds.
So it was a romance with a girl they met by chance, who everyone said ""Oh, look what a cool supergirl"" and so on.
And people were delighted, in love, literally.
It was a state of emotional euphoria, of falling in love.
Wow, everything is up, more and more beautiful, more and more fun.
I made money on this apartment, I'm renting it and look, I'm still making money on it.
Love. Love at first sight.
But unfortunately, it was a fiction, a hoax.
Now the scales are falling, now brutal facts are coming, now a double rate of credit is coming.
And suddenly, where is that love? Where is that wonderful, bright future?
I checked the prices of apartments in Opole, according to the data of the National Bank of Poland.
The last average price since the end of last year is less than 7,000 PLN per square meter of apartment.
In the case of Opole, you can't see a significant drop.
In other cities it is different, there are drops.
But on the other hand, inflation is very high.
Average rents are rising.
Or apartments have become more accessible, thanks to the fact that prices are standing and we earn more.
As far as I remember, when I was in Opole, it was not a big city.
And such prices, as you mention, are some sad joke.
To have prices like in much larger cities?
Where is the point here? Where is the economy?
This shows that prices are imposed, not based on demand and supply.
Of course, counting in nominal zlotys, as you noticed, is pointless.
Because the so-called purchasing power is counted, and it officially drops by almost 20% annually.
So how much bread loafs do you buy? Milk, butter?
It matters, not how much.
The price of an apartment does not matter.
If the number of purchases decreased by half,
although in fact these numbers are much lower than I estimate.
Official data from the financial sector, the banking sector, say
that 70% of the loans were paid.
So the fewer people will want to buy these apartments,
because people do not have these hundreds of thousands of zlotys for a tiny piece of land.
Because where would they have it from?
Those who had it a long time ago, bought it.
We can safely say that at least half of the willing fell.
And at this point, it is shocking that the prices of apartments have fallen.
This is shocking.
In addition, let's add the decline of many businesses,
and we return to the brutal awakening from a beautiful dream
that the media have painted for us for years.
Mr. Mariusz, time for a short break. We'll be back to the subject in a moment.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
I'm your host, as every week, the economist, financier, Mariusz Stefaniak,
the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we have the housing market on the wallpaper.
And our preface from 9 months ago.
Mr. Mariusz, 9 months ago in an interview for the ""New Polish Tribune""
you predicted that the price correction on the housing market
may reach 30%.
Perhaps some people have money and are waiting for these discounts,
for the opportunity.
We love the opportunity, we are waiting for the opportunity,
we know what the tenants sell, what the discounts are.
Maybe there is such a psychological mechanism here.
You know what? From what I remember, I said it a little differently.
I mean, according to my estimates, there should be such a correction
and it would more or less balance the changes that are.
But also from what I remember, I said that it would not be so easy,
because the items that rule the real estate market,
they usually have large capital resources,
so they can hold customers for a long time.
I don't remember exactly what numbers I threw,
but I suspect I said even years and so on.
And it is without a problem.
A company that has billions for many investments
will not worry that they will have a few of the built or under construction,
because they just can afford it.
I put forward a thesis today that this whole market is
not in accordance with market rules,
that is, it is controlled, to put it shortly.
Formally, informally, it doesn't matter.
What is important is that the prices of apartments do not comply with the normal law of the economy.
For example, a small city has prices of 90% of what is in a large city.
This is a complete absurd.
This is not how it should look like.
For some reason, the differences between us,
apartments in individual areas, individual cities, centers,
are not really big.
They should be shocking.
A few kilometers from the center it should be a sudden drop.
A dozen, a few dozen kilometers should be a total shock.
It's super cheap.
Because that's how it normally works.
But it's not like that.
We don't observe it in any way.
It's like you went to buy some food products.
In the city center you will pay several times more,
you will go to the village, you will pay several times less.
This is how it looks in practice,
when the price is not controlled.
And this is healthy, this is wise, this is sensible.
There is a place for different items, for different prices.
In the real estate sector, there is no such thing at all.
But does that mean we're dealing with a price contract?
I don't know if it's a formal price contract,
but the effect is what it is.
The price is imposed.
You can't negotiate this price,
you don't have any items that sell at different prices.
These prices are just set.
I doubt it would be such a deal,
everyone agrees and so on.
I don't suspect it would be impossible, practically.
It doesn't make sense to order it.
But it's enough that you have Oligopol,
that is, a few big guys who rule the market
and they impose prices and that's enough.
Especially if you see that the whole market is also controlled.
On the other hand, from the financing side,
from the banks, from the government side,
for some reason, this market is very rigid.
Which is absurd, as I said.
Mr. Mariusz, developer companies, banks
are already pressing the government, the authorities
to launch special programs
that will spin up construction.
There are ideas, a permanent loan of 2%
for the purchase of the first apartment.
There are even ideas for such apartments
to be non-percentage.
What do you think of such ideas?
Almost every political idea
concerning the economy is stupid.
And some of them are murderously stupid.
Why was he supposed to be wise for the change?
For me, there is no completely political meaning.
My assessment is always the same.
A politician is almost always a fatal economist.
It's like a prostitute being a fatal wife and mother.
Are there any exceptions?
Probably yes.
But it's stupid to count on miracles
and marry prostitutes.
It's just as stupid to give politicians
to decide about the economy.
What does a politician actually know,
what does the gentleman not know?
What companies were successful before he became a politician?
What does he know about the rules of the economy, management?
The answer is usually the same.
Nothing.
Well, you'd have to check it individually, probably.
No, the whole system doesn't make sense to me.
Normally, for centuries, it was like this,
that you had a class of professionals,
professionals in any field.
You also had people from the authorities,
usually monarchs,
and you had politicians,
so someone in the middle.
But these politicians didn't rule,
and they didn't make any decisions.
They were just a kind of a lubricant somewhere in between.
Now it's come to the point that people
who have no competence at all for government,
rule,
who have no competence at all for the economy,
make economic decisions,
it can't work well.
Like, look at any country
ruled in this way.
It's the same everywhere.
There is inflation,
there is corruption,
there is a growth of bureaucracy.
Because what can a politician do,
if he doesn't know the creditors?
He can increase the administrative side,
i.e. papers, stamps.
It doesn't require any knowledge,
no thinking, no reason.
He will put 10,000 of his colleagues in offices,
who will get a lot of money.
Anyone can do it.
And they do it beautifully, wonderfully.
They are the world champions in this.
They regulate life, they regulate.
They control, but they don't regulate.
You can regulate the river,
and then it flows better,
it serves you better.
And there is no regulation,
it's the opposite,
it's a complication.
What you did 10 years earlier,
a few minutes,
now you do it for a few weeks.
Let's add to this the whole computerization.
Everyone laughs at the government.
And do you remember that they told us
that if there are computers, there will be no papers?
And now we have computers,
and we have even more papers
than before.
It's nonsense,
who invented it, you tell me.
An economist?
A sensible man?
A banker?
No.
It was invented by politicians.
Mr. Mariusz, it's time for the second break,
but we'll be back to the subject in a moment.

What's up?
The third episode,
Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist,
a financier.
We're developing the housing market.
Mr. Mariusz,
what's the matter?
Why is the 2% loan
for a young man,
a young couple,
who is just starting out in life,
making money,
is so bad?
I'm not saying that the 2% loan is bad.
I'm just saying that the whole system
is bad.
From valuing apartments,
financing apartments,
managing apartments,
to what's hanging in the air,
and people don't want to take it into account,
which is disasters,
disaster taxes.
I've seen bills
that never went further
in the Polish parliament,
because individual governing teams
were afraid to present them to people.
But it's completely inevitable.
Now I see again,
I'm coming back to those proposals,
which were prepared and developed
many, many years ago,
because it's another
injustice on the real estate market,
on the housing market.
The very idea,
if it were so,
that you really have 2%
and you have an apartment at the moment,
and it's your property,
great, beautiful, wonderful, brilliant.
But unfortunately it's not like that,
it never was.
And I don't think it will be.
At least as long as this governing system,
as long as this global economic system
exists in this form.
Let's go back to the crisis
that we are starting to feel,
and there is nothing to hide.
As a society,
we are already tired of it,
although it only lasts a few months.
Maybe all these 2% loans
are one of the methods of enchantment of reality,
which will cause the crisis to end
quickly, easily, painlessly
and we will soon return again to the golden age.
You know what?
I remember such a joke.
The dead won't help the fool.
The mistake, the danger
and the main sin is in the whole system,
not in its individual details.
Let's change the interest rates a little,
let's change the reporting system,
the evidence,
it doesn't matter.
It's like you want to change the color of a tie for a bullet.
It will still be a corpse.
But what? Do we have to give birth to something new?
The corpse cannot be reanimated.
Exactly, you are right.
The corpse cannot be reanimated.
What is the only proper model of behavior?
To go through the grave after the dead.
First, to pay for his death.
Secondly, to bury him.
We will have a grave for a long, long time
after what is,
after this whole economic system.
You are absolutely right.
We will pay for it for a very long time.
Just like, let's remember 2008,
the famous crash of the population census in the US.
Ten years, the whole Western world rose up after
we had nothing to do with real estate in the US.
Ten years, the whole Western world, Poland too.
We paid for it for ten years, we rose up after what happened to them.
And basically nothing new was born afterwards.
After a dozen or so years, we have exactly the same thing as it was then,
only on a larger scale.
This is absolutely certain,
without any discussion.
How do you think about smart analysts in the US?
I'm not saying they are very popular on TV,
in the media, in the newspapers or on the radio.
They say exactly the same thing I say about Poland,
they say about the US.
That these politicians are evil,
bribery, stupid, incompetent.
The institutions that unnecessarily complicate it are evil
and of course they multiply various costs.
The whole system that allows people to take loans
when these loans are not indicated is evil.
It is bad that you buy banks that are poorly managed,
lose money, make stupid decisions.
The idea of taking a prostitute to your house is evil,
to live with her and have a common economy and common finances.
Because she will always steal from you,
she will always take out money from you,
because that's her mentality and you won't change anything in her head.
I'm sorry, there is no such method.
It won't heal the economy,
it won't heal the housing market,
it won't heal, as you say, these young people to have apartments,
and not to be in debt at absurdly high prices.
The prices of apartments in Poland have no real definition.
At the end of the hearing, we will ask questions from our listeners.
The first phone call from Mr. Zbigniew from Skoroszyc
was about a conversation about Polish coal.
The listener asks,
""Who is in charge of liquidating Polish mining?""
Mr. Mariusz, who?
We have known the answer since ancient times.
Hibono said the famous People's Tribune
and the famous judge Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravila.
In addition, another hint is the history of Poland.
Who has been interested in weakening, undermining, and even total destruction of Poland for centuries?
Let's add that coal is only one of the components of the equation.
The steel, cast iron, shipyard industry are further elements.
Completely by accident, everyone shared the same fate.
Who won it?
This is the famous question of this famous husband of the state,
coming from the people, who said,
""Who is it for?""
He came up with it, a modern method of judgment.
And he asked this question in every trial.
Who is it for? Who got it?
Who had the opportunity to commit this crime?
Who has such a strong influence in Poland to be able to decide in such areas?
If you do not know the answer at this point,
I will quote another saying,
""Who does not know history is doomed to repeat it.""
Thank you very much for your attention and we invite you to contact us by phone after the hearing.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz? Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist.
Today we are talking about the current situation of the Polish economy and Polish small businesses.
Portalbankier.pl reports on the increasing scourge of companies in Poland,
and this is specifically about small and micro-businesses.
The ZUS contribution has increased, the operating costs have increased, energy prices, fuel prices.
80% of people in such a small business believe that running a business in Poland is currently difficult and very difficult.
At the same time, however, if you look at the statistical data,
in a province like Opole, there are 110,000 companies registered for a million, not a whole million inhabitants.
And this number does not fall at all. Entrepreneurs complain, but few people liquidate their business.
Poles are warriors, they never give up, certainly not without a fight.
But it's a fight like with the 39th. The result is known.
It sounded very pessimistic, but let's get to the specifics.
I was talking to a farmer who is engaged in grain production.
After harvest, a ton of wheat cost about PLN 1,300-1,400.
Now it is PLN 300 less.
This is a tragedy for someone if they earn less at rising operating costs.
The government recently promised to compensate farmers for losses caused by the import of grain from Ukraine.
In this way, we all rely on support for farmers and to cover their losses.
Should it be like this?
All additional payments are a signal that it is bad and inconsistent with the economy standards.
It's like with coal. We have our own, but we destroy the mine, buy elsewhere, enrich speculators, intermediaries, stealing from our own citizens.
It's like in a casino. One loses, and the other wins.
Only somehow the casino never loses.
Just like politicians who make such decisions.
That is why I believe that a policy of a decisive economy is evil by itself.
Another example. The situation of small bakeries, which once dominated on such a small local market.
Recently, I talked to the owner of a bakery in a neighboring town. He closed the business because he was unable to maintain it.
He said that the prices of energy, gas, flour were so high that a loaf of bread should cost him PLN 10.
For such money, he would not buy this bread himself.
Looking from this perspective, we should be happy that cheap grain from Ukraine is coming to us, because there will be cheap flour and cheap bread.
I advised bakeries, so please believe me, I know this topic from the inside, from their business side, not only as a bread eater.
And in fact, this bread should cost not 10, but PLN 20, sir.
I know a small group of specialists in this field, that you do not buy bread in most cases, but water.
Because there are special chemicals added that stop the water in the bread when baking,
to use less flour and other sensible ingredients, and give something that is the cheapest.
If you really wanted to make real bread, it would have to be about twice as expensive.
This is one issue.
Another is that importing cheap grain is like running away from the rain.
We kill our own farmers economically better than Putin of Ukrainians.
Soon you will see the deaths of our entrepreneurs, the deaths of our farmers, and therefore the deaths of our citizens.
What do you have to pay for my money, to the mediators, to the speculators, to those who import all this coal, grain, everything we buy now?
Let's see the shelf in the store.
In general, in what store? Where do you have Polish stores?
Where do you have Polish producers? Even Polish farmers soon, because most of the fruit you will buy anyway,
some Spain, Italy, Argentina.
I understand you, this is how the rallies look like.
And what we should cut off with target barriers,
to introduce floodgates and not allow foreign grain or foreign food to Poland?
This is one of the methods, not necessarily the best or the healthiest, but certainly the fastest, but it is a better method.
Strengthen your own market, develop your own entrepreneurs, develop your own production networks.
Let others buy from us, because it is the best business.
Just like coal, I remember data from the communists, it was one of our best export products, sir.
Practically the entire development of the communist business, if you can call it that, was based on such things as coal.
We were a world potentate.
Steel, coal, casting, shipyard industry, we were a world potentate.
We really counted on the world.
Everyone knew, they bought from us.
Now we don't have a mine, we don't have a shipyard, soon we will not have our own farms, agricultural production.
What do you want this farm to live on? What do you want your family to live on?
Will you work in a German shop selling Ukrainian buns?
You will be a slave in your own country. This is the slave, sir, by definition, has nothing, has no property, does not decide for himself.
This is a real slavery.
What chains, chains do not matter.
Most of the slaves, sir, in the old days, did not walk in any chains.
I will tell you this much.
This is what it is about, that you do not decide anything, you have your own property.
This is slavery.
Mr. Mariusz, we will return to the thread after the break.

What is the game, Mr. Mariusz?
Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist, we are talking today about the current situation of the Polish economy, Polish small-scale businesses.
Let's move on to list the industries that have obvious problems.
In my area, suddenly, four recreation centers were put up for sale, and we are not some tourist deposit.
Newspapers report that the expensive food kills restaurants.
Poles do not afford food in the restaurant and prefer to cook at home.
These companies have survived the pandemic somehow and it turns out that they can not do it now.
Is this really a black scenario for the gastronomic and hotel industry?
These are real victims of COVID, as I said two years ago.
All experts are now saying that lockdowns were the stupidest thing you could do.
Both from a medical and economic point of view.
It's a pity that the experts themselves were not so smart and not brave then.
Why did they suddenly become smart and then they were so stupid?
Sometimes when I look at it, it seems to me as if someone had waged an economic war on Poles.
Because that's what it looks like and it's been exactly since the 90s.
You are making theses that encourage you to ask who waged this war on Poles.
I hope it will encourage people to search, read, learn and think.
The key to a good answer is a good question, sir.
I don't know for sure, but that's what it looks like to me.
That's why I make some theses that I also study, because I also don't have all the knowledge.
I'm looking for these answers.
And I'll be honest, that's what it looks like to me sometimes.
That it's like a war, that is, targeted actions, strikes on various sections of the front.
And then you know it's not a coincidence.
That, oh no, something accidentally flew into the air there.
That, oh, someone died there by accident.
Combine all these things.
Someone is waging a war with us.
Someone is attacking us on the front in a coordinated way.
These are not random events over the last few decades.
Our largest companies do not exist.
Our largest branches of industry are in total decline.
Let's compare now, for example, our neighbors.
It's not like that there.
Their main branches do not fall at all.
Not only that, what we have fallen, someone has become rich on it.
We do not sell sugar or coal or shipwrecks or castings or steel elements.
Someone sells it.
Now we are assemblies only for others.
We are a labor force, really.
We are literally such slaves.
It's not a coincidence that we dropped the mine, we dropped the shipyard, we dropped something there.
We are no longer talking about the case when 90% of a given industry falls on individual branches.
Poles are incredibly brave, incredibly tough, incredibly entrepreneurial.
We are serious European leaders, at least in these aspects.
Despite the worst conditions, legally, fiscal, to run a business, we are leaders.
As you have already said, there are very large percentages of entrepreneurs.
Because that's who we are.
We are smart, brave, entrepreneurial.
It's hard to break us.
But not everyone is counting losses.
Not everyone is counting losses. There are companies that have recorded very good profits last year.
For example, as the PZU group's Bankier.pl portal said, record profits last year.
Why is such an industry enjoying great profitability?
What does PZU produce?
Nothing.
Physically speaking, nothing.
Maybe just a sense of security.
Bravo.
You see, fictions, emotions, they do not create any value.
This is the funniest thing.
It's a very simple account.
And the account says one thing.
By paying insurance, you lose.
Profits, insurance companies, gigantic profits show it.
Most insurance companies never use you, and even if you use it, if you count how much you took and how much you paid, you are in the back.
You lost on it.
Physically, you lost.
And people never, never got any return, any insurance.
And they pay.
And now you say that banks, insurance companies, some of these items have profits.
Gigantic profits.
And what do they create?
What do they produce?
What do they bring into our economy?
They just take out, take the money.
A farmer brings, really.
An entrepreneur brings, produces, produces, offers various services, etc.
Well, it makes sense, you know, it builds the economy.
Such companies, they only produce stages, sir.
Comfortable stages for a certain political class that occupies there, sometimes brutally, even brutally, officially occupies their cousins, lovers, etc.
It's not a secret, and it applies to every team, to make it clear.
If we look at what really brings something into the economy, and what only takes from it, let's remove things that take money from our economy, for example, western markets.
What do they bring into your economy?
What do they take?
They take profits, sir.
They don't pay taxes.
They make it easier for me to shop, comfortable, modern.
What is the problem with it being a Polish market?
The Polish market did not organize itself at a sufficiently high level to compete.
And there are a few that have organized themselves.
And do you know why Polish markets are closing, falling?
I recently witnessed the closing of the LSS store with POE.
One of the oldest networks, the largest network of retail sales in Poland at that time, sir.
And do you know why?
They have to pay taxes.
Let them take the burdens that western markets do not have, and then we'll talk.
But a Polish entrepreneur has to pay a lot of burdens, taxes, etc.
A western entrepreneur does not have to.
It's terrifying.
No one would stand a healthy competition with the Poles.
No one, just no one. There is no such method.
Mr. Mariusz, time for a break.
The end of the first part
The end of the second part
The end of the third part
The end of the fourth part
The end of the fifth part
The end of the sixth part
The end of the eighth part
The end of the ninth part
The end of the tenth part
The end of the eleventh part
The end of the twelfth part
What is the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about the situation of our small Polish companies.
It turns out that in opposition to small Polish companies, large companies, at least in some industries, are doing well.
Another industry that has record profits is Orlen, fuel trade, fuel circulation, state energy companies.
Very good results. We all see it in our wallets, our energy expenses are growing.
Will these prices ever stabilize and fall to the previous level?
I will answer question by question. Will we ever liquidate monopolies?
We liquidate them all the time, but we never succeeded.
We have an anti-monopoly system, etc.
Well, because monopolies pay off the most.
I had a little bit, you mentioned that you forgot about the industry associated with alcohol.
Monopoly shops, breweries, etc. These are also industries that account for large profits.
Because the worse it is, the more people drink. I'm sorry.
Well, it's true.
Who consumes the most drugs? Who drinks the most?
Only two groups of people, sir.
Mr. Mariusz, I know wealthy people who also overuse alcohol. If you're going that way.
I'm going that way.
The poorest and the richest people.
Exactly, because of hopelessness. I know it sounds funny, but these are people who have no hope, no goal.
On the one hand, those very poor, no matter what they do, they don't believe they will succeed.
And the second group, those who have everything, but at the same time have a lot of psychological and sometimes physical burdens.
This is also a very difficult life.
It's on this principle. Do you know who is the healthiest part of any society?
Economic, certainly the middle class.
Both mentally and morally, all the assets are in the middle class.
It is the most important.
In the economy, in politics, in religion, in culture, in everything, really.
There was a noble class in Poland.
When it fell, the Republic of Poland fell, sir.
Look what's going on in Poland.
In Poland, a lot of poverty is being created and a group of extremely rich people,
which in my opinion is no different in my worldview from such complete degenerate menelis.
Because they will do everything too and they have no rules, no morality,
they do not carry any cultural or national values.
They are just lost people.
I don't know if you know, but there is such a very nice statistic that says that no super rich race lasts longer than three generations.
And now the simple question is why noble families lasted many, many generations, but not so super rich anymore?
These are very interesting topics.
Always look at the country, every country, every economy, every culture through the prism of the middle class.
If it is strong, no matter how politicians are, it doesn't matter at all.
They don't count.
The middle class is the foundation, is the support, is the economic, moral, cultural support.
Our middle class is completely destroyed, it dies at all possible traps.
For this, a gigantic pauperization, such a total degeneration of most of society is created.
And an incredibly rich elite of so-called businessmen is being created.
But let's face it, none of them is a businessman.
They are not businessmen in my opinion.
They didn't do any business.
They didn't invent anything, they didn't create, they didn't patent.
These are people who had government contracts, services, or were even agents.
Well, who becomes a reporter, an agent?
It's not Hans Kloss, so to speak, in the film.
It's not James Bond, sir.
Where do we have strong people, strong businessmen?
Such real, not those who have catchers or some government contracts.
So that's why I'm talking about people starting to look at business, at the economy.
Not as magical, difficult, complicated systems, but for such obvious, clear.
The foundation of the economy is the middle class.
Not the rich, not the poor who seem to decide in the elections.
They don't matter.
You will bribe the poor with a party, a party.
Let them shout and wave their scarves with beer.
Politicians love such people.
The economy is a very simple and logical thing.
When you stop being afraid of this topic and start looking at the facts.
Farmers are important, and it's rich farmers.
Where are the rich farmers, sir?
But we are not talking about a farmer who has thousands, thousands of hectares.
And where does he get them from?
Because he had a deal with some government, with some politicians.
And he took over all the GDP for, for example, a zloty.
I can tell you the names of very famous people, who I know for sure did it.
Because I even know where their land is.
Because there are thieves, there are speculators.
These are catchers.
Where are the real farmers?
Let's see the rich countries, where they stand.
America has become rich.
Just on such farmers, for example, cattle.
Texas, Arizona.
But these are normal people.
You will go to him, he is normal, ordinary.
But he, if you count his wealth, he is super rich.
Yes, he is.
But there are a lot of such people.
That's what we lack.
Gołębiewski - a great hotel, a great businessman.
He is dead.
What killed him?
Covid killed him.
The entire empire of Wallachia was razed to the ground.
Which he built for several decades.
We need such people.
But there are fewer and fewer of them.
They are destroyed, bankrupt, die.
How is he supposed to live?
How is he supposed to develop his business?
Who takes his place?
Let's stop it.
Let's make this moment of today's hearing.
Let's all take care of the middle class, because it's worth it.
Thank you very much for the interview.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is, as every week, an economist, a financier,
the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation,
Mariusz Stefaniak.
I would like us to talk about inflation today.
After all, it's been a favorite topic of economic media for over a year.
Recently, the president of the National Bank of Poland announced
that for the first time in many months, the rate of inflation in Poland has dropped a bit.
In March, we had 16% increase in inflation throughout the year,
while a year ago it was 14%.
Let us remind you that in the first year of the pandemic,
i.e. in 2020, inflation was only 3.5%.
Why is inflation so high in general?
At first, maybe an important note.
Talking about inflation is always talking about something
that we cannot say anything about exactly.
About something we don't know.
There is no number that shows us exactly what this enigmatic inflation is.
You can manipulate these numbers quite freely.
And the only thing we know about inflation is that we definitely don't know what it is.
This is so that it is known what we are talking about.
We know price indicators, i.e. prices for a set of articles
that were on average a year ago, two years ago.
That's how it counts.
I know how it counts.
In the calculation technique and in the method of creating these averaged values,
you would understand what I'm talking about.
There are three levels of lies.
Small lie, big lie and statistics.
If you have to choose, manipulate prices,
you will suddenly say, ""Wait, wait, this is some kind of science fiction.""
Well, literally, it is.
We don't even know if it's 10 or 20.
That's the truth.
We feel that it is growing, because we feel it in our wallets.
Yes, you are right.
It is definitely visible whether inflation is falling or increasing.
Absolutely.
Not only that, every country has its own factors.
The European Union has GDP.
We have GDP, most often used.
In addition, inflation is not one word,
because we have many types of inflation.
The Central Bank uses basic inflation.
There are many types of analyzed, calculated.
Which shows that we really don't know what we're talking about.
But why is it growing, Mr. Mariusz?
Why is it growing like this?
There is only one reason I know.
I'm listening carefully.
Inflation results from a poor economic state.
The state, read, from a bad management.
I don't know any other reason.
Apparently, inflation gives the government additional income.
I wonder if it always happens like this,
or at some point the situation simply comes out of control.
It's not really about additional income.
Inflation is a phenomenon that brutally punishes people,
who are hard-working, honest,
and rewards losers, thieves and manipulators.
The government uses the most on inflation.
They are very good at high inflation.
And especially when we talk about poorly managed countries.
This means that they are paying their debt internally.
In fact, the government has no money, to put it shortly.
It doesn't create anything by itself.
It doesn't produce anything.
It can only live on someone's work.
And now, when you think about it,
someone's work,
that is, people who really introduce some value to the economy,
are the ones who lose the most on inflation.
And the government, which owes heavily,
or can't manage the money it takes from you,
not only takes it, but also spends it.
Not only does it spend the money it gets from you,
it also destroys those who give it to it.
It steals it in many ways,
for example, through inflation.
Because inflation steals those who have savings, for example.
It punishes them for having money.
Because you have to separate two things,
a fictional currency, banknotes,
from the real value in the economy.
The economy works on two levels.
On the fictional level, nominal,
and on the real level.
We're not talking about inflation indicators,
we're also talking about some fictional numbers
that someone can manipulate,
calculate as they please,
choose baskets, set averages.
You know, these are very big possibilities of manipulation.
And the real level,
which is what the real life level of people
is rising or falling,
everyone will know it.
You will go to any country
and within an hour they will tell you what the economic state is like,
without knowing any parameters, nothing at all.
It's that simple.
Mr. Mariusz, but inflation affects not only Poland,
but all the countries of the EU, the United States.
Are all economies sick?
Yes, you noticed it well.
Good, quite a deep thought.
You know what globalization is.
That's why all economies are sick.
Because if you have five tanks of water
and you poison one with water,
what will happen after some time,
in an inevitable way?
The disease will spread.
Exactly, bravo!
Exactly, this is a real pandemic.
This is something that kills us, literally, literally.
People are dying and will die en masse
because of the destruction of the economy,
i.e. the source of their livelihood.
Because that's what you live from, what you produce.
And if you don't produce anything,
if someone else destroys the money you produce
and destroys the source of the money you produce,
i.e. for example, destroys your business,
then you will simply die.
There is no other option.
There is no such magic.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to a break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is, as every week,
an economist, a financier,
the president of the ""Więcej Modrości"" foundation,
Mariusz Stefaniak.
Today we are working on inflation.
Mr. Mariusz, is it so difficult to predict
what inflation will be like?
Our president of our National Bank of Poland,
Adam Glapiński,
for two years became a target
because his forecasts
were completely wrong.
He said it would be lower,
and it was higher.
Can we count it somehow?
There are many lies here that could be
decoded.
First of all, the very institution of the National Bank of Poland
is already something that is
suspected in the economy.
Because, think about it, if we have a free market,
why do we need central control of this market?
The NBP is exactly that.
It is the central control of the financial system.
Well, through the NBP, the government
influences the economy.
No, not really.
If it were so, it would be even,
in my opinion, less bad.
It would be an independent entity from the government.
Legally.
It is known that the NBP president is appointed
by the majority of the parliament, which is not the government.
Well, okay, but let's separate these things.
He is elected by politicians
and in certain political systems,
but then there is no influence on him.
So you can't call him back,
you can't change his decision, and so on.
So, in fact, the NBP president,
to a very large extent, shapes the policy,
the financial policy of the monetary country.
In short, it has a very big influence
on, for example, what inflation is.
So he can't predict it himself.
It's like a driver who drives on a given route
every day and you ask him
how far we will get to the next stop.
In two minutes.
15 minutes have passed, but we haven't arrived.
Oh, I was wrong.
For which time will you understand
that asking this driver makes no sense,
he is simply incompetent.
After all, he is driving this vehicle.
This is exactly the position I see the NBP president in.
I checked the forecasts and implementations
year after year,
tears flowed from my eyes.
Everything that the smartest people in Poland
have developed, or nominally,
theoretically, who know the economy
and those who influence this economy.
Their forecasts make no sense.
If someone is wrong several times,
it's not a small mistake.
It's a crushing difference.
And this is the one who creates this policy,
influences it.
And he is not able to get to this once a year,
what level it will be at all?
But this indicates that he does not want
to limit inflation.
After all, they chose him after the election.
And where did we start, sir?
Inflation is a red hand for politicians.
The higher the inflation, the better for the government,
because he pays off his internal debt.
Not only did he take money from you,
he also borrowed money,
because he didn't have enough money yet,
which he took from you.
And now inflation causes
that the value of this money,
i.e. the purchasing power of money,
falls, so he borrowed a thousand zlotys from you,
and he paid you 500 zlotys,
because inflation ate up the rest.
The government simply gets rid of its debts,
i.e. it masks its bad management.
It is very, very easy for them.
Not only that, in this way you can borrow wealth,
because you borrow shares in various companies, etc.
So you can very easily
buy something in this way.
A lot of benefits for governments
based on high inflation.
As I said,
there are various international aspects,
speculative,
big business appears then.
But, sir, these are gigantic places
to earn gigantic money.
And who makes money on it?
Politicians, they are not mistaken.
I can literally mention the names of the corrupt politicians,
which we already know,
and how many we do not know.
And we certainly know
that this entire political class is very suspicious,
and they make these decisions.
Why would they fight inflation, sir?
Because then he has to make good,
healthy economic decisions,
which will be very unpopular
for this society,
which does not want to work hard,
can not work, can not earn.
In short, we are talking about the majority of people.
The donkey that pulls the cart
has a contribution to it,
but it does not produce it.
The one who invented the whole business,
organized, created,
yes, he is this driving force.
Well, Mr. Mariusz,
the answer of people to inflation,
people working,
which you mentioned here,
is the demand for higher pensions.
Their money has a lower value,
they want to have more of this money.
If there are no increases,
there will be social protests,
and the rulers in Poland give these increases.
Minimum wage is growing,
various groups are growing,
which depend on the government.
In this case, shouldn't the rulers
bow down to these demands
and the wages should be frozen?
Should ordinary people pay for inflation?
Neither one nor the other, nor the third.
None of these options make sense.
Any statutory minimum wages,
it's just an idiotic tragedy.
This is communism.
You see, communism does not work,
communism does not work,
communism is antilogical,
anti-economic, anti-economic.
The more communism in the economy,
the worse.
The less you see that this is stupid,
you have tea,
and you add a microscopic dose
of some syphilis additive.
No problem.
100% of this syphilis additive in tea,
well, you're throwing up.
Communism is just a syphilis additive
to our lives, sir.
This is the first factor,
you said about three.
Yes, so the reaction of people
that they want such a guarantee,
that we want communism,
and this is stupid,
this is a government reaction
to the reaction of these people,
who they want to satisfy,
to vote for them.
And it's idiotic,
the government does not bake the wounds
of a cut leg with fire,
but sticks the patches
and adds bows to it.
And a little bit of painkillers.
You have an anticovid shield,
and what is it supposed to give?
These are such fundamental things
that are not talked about,
and it's bad that it's not talked about.
Inflation can be overcome
only in one direction,
cutting the source of inflation.
And the source of inflation
is bad management, sir.
And you can't overcome bad management
with even worse management.
Before the next round of questions,
I invite you for a break.
The end
The end
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier,
today he explains to us
the intricacies of inflation.
Mr. Mariusz,
maybe we're overdoing it all.
Maybe the inflation rate of 16 or 18 percent
is not a special tragedy,
because if we compare it
to the situation 100 years ago,
when hyperinflation prevailed in Germany,
a rate of 30,000 percent
per month,
well, ours is a small peak.
How could you live
in inflation conditions
that are several thousand percent
month to month?
You can, and people live like that.
Today, of course, Venezuela is an example.
Once the richest country in Latin America,
now a country that is the most dangerous,
with the highest crime rate.
So you can destroy
even an Eldorado like Venezuela.
In fact, you can live there, of course.
And people live there,
earning three dollars a month.
Where, for example, two bottles of cola
cost a monthly payment.
It's really countless.
And people can live there.
People lived in concentration camps.
You can live in practically any conditions.
And the only question is
whether we want it,
whether we are heading for it,
or whether we want to compare to it, you know.
Being a big European country.
But does that mean that
Venezuela is in danger?
We are in much worse danger
than Venezuela, really.
I have doubts.
Maybe it's a matter of wishes,
but I definitely wouldn't like to live in Venezuela.
I have nothing against Venezuela,
as long as I could earn
outside of Venezuela.
Then it's a very good life.
Because having a hundred dollars a month,
you are literally a king there.
Unless someone comes to rob me.
Which is practically standard.
And actually,
if you look at the middle class,
it's just such a huge norm there,
that the question is
whether you managed to survive,
escape,
and how many attacks did you survive.
I will once again reach for historical analogies,
or historical examples.
Historians describing hyperinflation
from 100 years ago
said that it was the effect of the military economy,
huge expenses on armaments.
We are also spending more and more money on armaments now.
And my question is,
what impact can it have on inflation?
First of all, I do not agree with the thesis
that in the Weimar Republic,
because we probably talk about it,
hyperinflation was the result of arms.
No, it's not true.
In fact,
for this reason, among others,
World War II broke out.
Of course, no one crazy Hitler
can avoid any war,
because he talks in a pub.
The world doesn't work like that.
It was the economy that led to it.
Our current actions,
gigantic arms purchases,
are, in my opinion,
as an economist,
inexplicable.
I can't imagine
someone who is not a complete madman
thinking that we will fight Russia.
So why do we need it?
That's why we are a NATO party,
that the whole NATO is supposed to defend us.
That's why we pay there, among others.
That's why we belong.
That's why we fulfill our duties.
On the other hand,
if we have a fatal economy,
then gigantic expenses,
which put us as one of the leaders
when it comes to arms expenses.
A country that is super-debted
and in the most fundamental aspects
has an unsafe existence,
there is no security in any aspect,
neither energy,
nor telecommunications,
nor any other, really.
We are dependent on other countries.
We have no independence
in any aspect of our activity
as a country.
And we suddenly spend
gigantic arms money here.
Who pays for it?
Of course, we go back to the point
that entrepreneurs, businessmen,
those who generate a real impact on the budget,
will pay for it.
Because of course,
we will draw in internal or external loans,
we will weaken our currency
through macabre printing of money.
Because there is no other way
to finance it.
Well, we sell half of Poland instead?
I don't think anyone would dare
to make such a decision.
I don't know if you know about this scenario.
It was said completely openly
in the context of Greece.
Yes, the offer of Greek sales
was a bit more open.
Which is easier to allocate territorially.
Yes, we are talking about real offers
that have already fallen
on the international arena.
So that's why I mention it,
so that listeners are fully aware
of these various options
that are somewhere
on the desk of the decision makers.
But no matter what option it is,
it will definitely be unprofitable for Poles.
And above all, it will be unprofitable,
as I said,
for the most important group of Poles,
for those who generate
our economic growth,
our GDP,
who generate impact on the budget,
they will suffer the most.
In short, in the long run,
instead of strengthening,
we will weaken even more.
What economic benefits
will arms purchases give us?
It makes sense, for example, for Americans.
They are the producers of this armament.
They transfer money
to very rich concerts,
Lockheed Martin and so on.
So this money stays in America.
So they actually transfer
from the public budget
to the private one.
And we are doing the worst option
that exists in the world.
So from the budget of our public,
that is, from the pockets of citizens,
to foreign companies,
to foreign countries.
We enrich them with billions of dollars,
which we do not have,
because we are in debt
and we will be even more in debt.
And this is the whole misfortune
of such ideas and such transactions.
Of course, we will pay for it.
As I say, there is no other option.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you for today's meeting.
Thank you.
Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.
And for the sake of order,
let us remind you of the phone number
under which we are waiting for your questions.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest, as every week, is Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we are talking about the widely known state protectionism.
I read the first ""Rolny"" portal,
it's an internet portal dedicated to agriculture.
Recently, it described the backstage of food import from Ukraine.
Because it's not just about grain, which was recently announced,
it's also about corn, chickens, vegetables.
After the outbreak of the war, a year ago, the European Union set a zero target
for agricultural products from Ukraine.
And it turns out that thanks to this, the Dutch company,
which has a company with the oligarch there in Ukraine,
brought more or less 700 pounds of chickens from Ukraine to the Netherlands every month.
In the Netherlands, he packed them and sent them to shops, also to Poland.
They cost 13 zlotys per kilogram, while from a Polish farmer they were 30% more expensive.
And it turns out that this lack of a goal that was supposed to help Ukraine
actually helps to earn money for oligarchs and the Western concern.
Mr. Mariusz, could it have been predicted?
Absolutely not. Such knowledge was available only to a few,
and for most people it was completely impossible.
And do you know why?
I don't know. If I knew, I would probably take such an interest.
Because it requires rejecting the media's propaganda and using one's own intellect
in combination with logical thinking.
And it's such a complicated and non-existent in the minds of most of the knowledge as history.
I suggest that one day you, just for fun, watch any street courts
about the greatest and most famous historical events or characters.
I'll be honest, it's funny, but also scary.
No one predicted it and now few people know what it's about.
But we have authorities that should be transparent,
have the required knowledge and should predict such things and avoid them.
The authorities predicted it and they knew it. I'm absolutely sure of it.
Mr. Mariusz, there is something like purchasing patriotism,
that is, buying your products from companies that you want to support.
Recent studies show that Poles, when shopping, are now mainly guided by price.
At least it has become more popular since inflation has gone up.
Purchasing patriotism and putting your own products on the shelf has decreased by half.
And how to distinguish Ukrainian chicken from Polish chicken?
Does it make sense as a fight or a way to eliminate unwanted phenomena?
It makes perfect sense.
If someone doesn't do it, the only question is when he will cry and complain,
because it is absolutely inevitable.
What you call purchasing patriotism is not purchasing patriotism at all.
It is just a minimum of logical thinking.
You look at a river that flows through your garden and your neighbor's.
Suddenly, the neighbor digs so that he misses your plot and there is a place for you to help me dig.
And then you sit on the burnt ground, dry, the neighbor is swimming in this river, which is all his.
And now the question is whether taking care of the river flowing through your plot is some kind of great patriotism,
or just a minimum of human thinking.
What is water in this example?
Money, income.
Exactly.
It is said in economics that money flows are the bloodstream of the state.
So if you let the blood flow from the Polish economy through financing foreign companies,
then you are cutting your own veins.
People commit economic suicide, so it is not patriotism.
It is just a self-preservation instinct, sir.
See what is happening in the world.
Which countries are strong and which are weak?
Those that have a strong economy.
Where do they have a strong economy?
Because this bloodstream flows in their bodies.
You do not give blood to someone else.
I do not know if you ever gave blood.
You were certainly taken blood, but did you give it?
And I do not know if you know what happens to the body when you give half a liter of blood.
What's going on with the body?
Head twists, weakening, fogging.
It's exactly the same with the economy, sir.
So you can let this blood go for a little bit, let's help the poor Ukrainians a little bit.
Okay, okay, great.
But you know, we just cut our veins and someone drinks our blood.
The so-called capitalist Europeans are joking here, of course, but you understand what I'm talking about.
Because this is again a communist jargon that shows a phenomenon, but interprets it purposefully.
This is not patriotism, sir, it's just some kind of idiocy.
If we talk about autism.
In the rescue service, it is a rule to save in such a way, but never in such a way as to pose a threat to the rescuer.
Bravo, bravo, bravo.
You see, wise rules are wise.
We can help, we can save, but as you said, the most important rule, if I drown in it, we will both drown, it's stupid.
I'll tell you this, I also sailed a little, also at sea.
When we had a storm at the Mediterranean Sea, Captain Uda said that if someone falls out, we do not go back for him, because in these conditions he will not take such a risk with this crew.
He is a very smart man, my friend, a very nice man, very helpful, kind and so on, but at the same time thinking, you know, as if knowing the realities.
Listen, if I try in these conditions, this yacht, with this crew, to try to take someone out of the water, we will all die at 99.9.
End of the dot.
The chances of saving someone in this weather are minimal.
So what? I'll kill a dozen people so that I can save one?
Well, it's absurd.
Mr. Mariusz, we will continue to support you in a moment, I invite you to the break.
The end of the dot.
The end of the dot.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"".
Today we are talking about taxes, but...
I read on the portal many.pl such information,
which was very eagerly picked up by other media,
that our houses will be visited by controllers.
And these controllers will check,
if we provided real data about our house
to the building emission database.
Controller will check what we're burning, what is the house meter.
I'm ignoring the doubts that have arisen around this matter,
but I've calculated it briefly.
In this database of building emissions there are currently 9 million houses.
If checking one will take a quadranth, and probably will take much more,
and if we assume that an hour of work of such a controller costs 35 zlotys,
then the whole operation of checking will cost at least 100 million zlotys.
Why spend such money?
What does it give? To whom? To the authorities? Mr. Mariusz?
So, all these records, checks, voluntary and forced surveys,
serve only one purpose.
It's certainly not for the good of these poor citizens, controlled.
The point is to look at all this in a broader perspective, in the long run.
And then the whole mystery is perfectly explained.
All this is preparation for a great action,
which I have been following for many years,
and I present that it is absolutely 100% inevitable,
and it's called ""Additional sources of taxation on us"".
And that's all. There is no other purpose here.
And so we are super taxed, but as you can see, politicians never have enough of taxing,
because taxes are additional free money.
So why not take it?
Mr. Mariusz, but there are already various types of bases in offices,
evidence of the foundations, there are universities in books,
every building is written in such a book.
Why is it not enough for the authorities?
Because there is a huge mess there, sir.
And whoever, whatever he did with real estate, investments,
it inevitably comes to the conclusion that there is just a gigantic mess.
The documents are not organized, they are dying, there are terrible gaps in the documentation,
departments are between each other, and offices are also completely between each other,
they have no meaningful exchange of information,
one office does not know what the other office is doing.
I could give you hundreds of examples that I have experienced.
These are funny on the one hand, terrible on the other,
because it shows that hundreds of thousands of officials do not know what they are doing.
That's why, if you look closely, you will see that for the last few years
the government has not been doing as much better management,
but better data collection for Poles, to tax them better.
You can see it in the tax havens, in the municipal offices, at any level.
And this is obvious to me.
It is 100% clear what it is about, what is happening,
and as an economist I know what the purpose of this is.
Mr. Mariusz, but for years we have also been scared by the controls in the houses
that are supposed to check whether we have a radio, a TV and whether we pay a subscription.
Well, so far, such controls have not been used en masse.
Maybe we have no reason to be afraid of new controllers.
You know what? We have nothing to be afraid of, no controllers,
because in fact the only healthy reaction, in my opinion,
would be to throw all these controllers out on the ground,
dig them out, say that it's just all illegal, we are free people,
and no one will come into our property with shoes.
When we have already paid for it a long time ago, and sometimes several times.
And this is the basic truth for people to understand.
Taxes are not paid by free people.
Taxes, taxes, were paid by people who were ""paid"", sir.
They paid ""paid"". Taxes were not paid by rich people, not by free people.
Taxes were always paid by those who are at the very bottom.
Losers.
There was a saying that a nobleman in the garden is equal to a voivode.
In short, you could be a super poor nobleman, but no one had the right to enter your property.
It doesn't matter if he was a king, it didn't matter.
Because it was your sanctuary, so here you were the king.
Now, the gentleman can pack as much as he wants and still hang himself there.
So who are we in this case?
Are we free citizens?
After all, we are actually the owners of this country.
The officials are our employees.
It is a fact that in former Poland, every tax had to be agreed upon in the Sejm.
It is difficult to call all Poles to one big Sejm, where everyone will agree on a tax,
or at least most of them will agree on a tax, because they probably won't agree.
And very rightly so.
Let me tell you this, the simplest method in the world to verify whether a country is well-governed,
whether it is rich or poor.
Just look at the tax system.
This is the best indicator of this.
What should the tax system be like?
Because taxes must exist.
The tax system should be very simple.
We tax only those things that come to us from outside,
that is, we tax others, not our own citizens.
Thank you. End of the tax system.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to a break, we will return to the topic.

Mr. Mariusz, what's going on?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we are generally talking about taxes,
but we started with the identification of buildings,
controlling buildings, how big they are, who has what, etc.
Mr. Mariusz, as a journalist, I have been following the ideas of introducing a tax
in the Sejm for several years now.
Because we don't pay such a tax now.
Let's start with what a tax is and what effect it would have on people.
A tax is another form of stealing citizens.
And you have to make it clear to yourself.
On what basis should someone ask for money from you, from your property?
Such a thing can be called a compulsion.
The mafia comes and says, ""Okay, now you will pay me.""
But why? Because we are stronger and we can hurt you.
And what do you have to pay for? You are rich, what do you have to pay for?
No, unfortunately not. If it were so, it would be great.
I don't think there is any problem.
Unfortunately, the facts are such, in any country, because it is true everywhere,
that the rich do not pay.
If you are small, poor and weak, then you are being robbed.
Then you are forced to pay money. Taxes are forced.
Let's see the list of the richest Poles.
I checked it.
I remember that probably one in a hundred paid taxes in Poland.
One. Physically one.
Mr. Marysz, but there is already a tax on real estate.
We pay it to the municipality, we pay a farm tax, if someone has a farmland,
if someone has a forest, they pay a forest tax.
What is the difference between a disaster tax and the existing ones?
There are many differences, including the fact that you can squeeze out
many times more money on this tax than on any other.
In my opinion, this is the main fundamental difference.
But it will result from the very construction of these taxes.
We have great examples in different countries, so I can also say a few things about it.
No problem.
Let's take an example.
Let's say a married couple who lives in a big city and has been living for decades,
let's say, on a surface of 100 square meters of an old tenement house.
In Wrocław, in Krakow, such apartments are worth 10,000 PLN per square meter.
And such an apartment is worth a million.
And now an official comes, taxes its value, calculates the tax and has to pay a rate of, let's say, 1%.
Well, 1% per year from a million is 10,000 PLN.
Yes, you are right. I have been analyzing this topic for many years.
Once I came across such documentation as the draft of the Polish law on disaster tax.
And there was a value written in there, as far as I remember, I say from my head, of course, after many years, 2%.
So 20,000 in the case of this apartment.
For example, yes, because such were the proposals.
And please believe me that such rates are in the world, they are even higher.
In Singapore, there is 4%.
There may be such rates.
And now imagine a pensioner who has several hundred zlotys of pension and will have to pay him 1,000 zlotys per month of the tax itself.
When he has no income at this level.
This is a beautiful mechanism of rapid poverty alleviation.
And moreover, the most valuable real estate is taken for free.
Because please imagine that such people usually have no legal existence.
They are not too dynamic, because they are sick, for example.
They may be in a different mental state, they may have depression, etc.
They may be lonely.
They are most sensitive to all attacks, to all forces, intimidation.
So it's easiest for them to take their property.
After all, it's the thieves who are in charge of it.
Who are they attacking?
Not young, strong, healthy bulls, but older people.
Lonely older people.
They are wasting money or even gangly attacking.
Yes, for scammers it is a perfect goal.
As you can see, it's a perfect goal for everyone.
But maybe there are some positive effects of such an operation.
We assume that someone is planning it.
Maybe, for example, he will organize the real estate market.
And he will force or oblige people who cannot afford to maintain large apartments.
To sell them, move to smaller ones.
Don't you see any positives?
I see a lot of positives.
The positives are that the rich will be even richer.
That politicians will have more money to give to themselves, their friends, their families.
In senseless transactions, where 50, 60, 70% of the value is lost.
Classic examples of scams, corruption, public orders, scheduled bargains, etc.
These are the positives.
Only the positives concern, sir, only 1% of the richest people, the best-off people in the country.
And 99% will be made up of it.
This is exactly what the tax system is about.
And especially the real estate tax system.
In short, the more you have built in your family for centuries, generations, the more we will rob you.
Because you have 1, 2, 3 apartments.
And at this point you will pay for what you have already paid for a long time.
In income taxes, various types of taxes, notarial payments.
You have already paid a lot of times for it.
And of course you had to buy it somehow.
So you bought it with money that was already taxed.
You have already paid many times for what is supposedly your property.
And now someone comes and says, ""Okay, but I want you to pay me more for it.""
But on what basis?
That is why the positives are for 1%, the negatives for 99% of Polish residents.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to take a break.
Our listeners deserve a moment of rest.

What is played, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
Today we are talking about taxes, and especially about the disaster tax.
Is it possible in Poland? Is anyone considering introducing it?
What do we look like in the background of other countries?
Maybe we are the last country that does not yet have a disaster tax, and everyone has introduced such a tax around.
Well, we are not the last country that does not have it, but in fact, the vast majority of countries have a disaster tax.
For fun, of course, I will say that one of the richest countries in the world, with an average income per capita, has no taxes.
I am talking about the Arab Emirates.
These rich countries do not have to do this.
All countries around us, especially from Europe, have such forms of tax, but they look very, very different.
For example, Germany has rates from 0.25 to 1%, values ​​are determined there based on type and location.
France and Belgium set the income generated by a given real estate.
Great Britain is divided into two categories, i.e. commercial and non-commercial.
0.5% for the lowest, least attractive.
For the highest, the rate is set individually, so it can be several times higher.
There are a lot of different solutions, but in general, the rates are from 0.5% to somewhere around 2%, more or less.
Well, the perspective is not very attractive from the point of view of an average citizen.
There is something like this, maybe more in publicism than in law, like the Tax Freedom Day.
This year we will celebrate it in Poland on June 13.
It is the 164th day of the year and symbolically only after 164 days we stop working for the state and for the state,
and we start earning for ourselves.
Various types of taxes, at the moment it is about 43% of all our earnings.
And my question to you is, is there a limit to these tax burdens that the state can impose on citizens,
a limit that should not be exceeded at all?
There is no such limit.
You can tax citizens many times higher than their possibilities and income.
It is absolutely possible.
There are no contraindications to this.
We see a lot of such examples.
If you look at our part of the world, because it is probably more interesting to us,
it is practically the state that takes from somewhere 30% to 60% of people's money,
which of course translates into the calculation you are talking about.
Historically, the first calculations were from 1900, when this term was created,
it was in the USA and the burden was at 5.9%, i.e. 6%.
And now, sir, we jump 100 years and we have 60%.
You can see what's going on.
What I said before, you see how it is beautifully confirmed?
In facts, in numbers.
Governments steal citizens.
Once it was 6%, now it is 60%, because the administration is broken up.
Because the staff of the office governs us where it should serve us.
This is the assumption of the government.
The government is the economist you hire to manage your property, i.e. your country.
They increased the burden on the owners 10 times, i.e. on us.
And what do we have for it?
Inflation.
Thank you.
Great business.
I am really impressed.
Mr. Mariusz, but there are rich countries in Western Europe,
which we always watch and show as countries we would like to follow, for example.
Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, countries with a developed society, with a rich society.
And there, these tax burdens are even greater.
This day of tax freedom is celebrated there even later.
Exactly the countries you mentioned are the absolute top when it comes to stealing citizens.
Sweden - 57%.
Germany - 52%.
France - 53%.
You hit it perfectly.
Okay, but maybe these citizens are happy,
because I see Germans, French, Swedes many times happy with themselves and their lives.
Maybe this system serves them.
Mr. Mariusz, the Germans were happy when Hitler murdered half of Europe,
so this is not a determining factor for me.
You know, apparently Hitler also pleased them a bit.
Of course, yes.
Hitler was democratically elected and people loved him completely.
Until the last months of the war, he was a politician who had the highest popularity among all politicians,
to make it funnier.
This is amazing and it is not a matter of course, but it is a fact.
Hitler was not a dictator, as they say.
He was a truly democratically elected ruler and a beloved ruler.
But I come back to my question.
Maybe in a country that takes so many people, people can still be happy and satisfied?
Of course, yes. I read a lot of different documentaries about concentration camps and so on.
And please believe me that people were extremely satisfied, so ecstatically happy in concentration camps,
because, for example, I managed to get an extra loaf of bread,
because they did not get any powerful beating or they got a relatively small beating.
If someone was not tortured and kicked to death, he turned out to be happy,
being hungry, almost dead, with the perspective that this is how the rest of his life will look like.
So, you know, people can be happy in absurd situations.
It is difficult to argue with this, Mr. Mariusz.
Thank you very much for this last comparison.
It is very thought-provoking.
Thank you very much for the interview.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, President of the Foundation Więcej Mądrości.
And I once again remind you of the phone number under which we are waiting for your opinion, questions 536-286-286.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
We're talking about the situation of the National Bank of Poland.
I read some terrifying data about the financial loss of the National Bank of Poland
for the past year.
In previous years, the National Bank of Poland had quite a lot of profits,
which always go to the state budget.
And last year, our National Central Bank,
headed by President Adam Glapiński,
brought 17 billion zlotys in losses.
For me, that's a huge amount.
Does that mean that the state budget,
that is, we will all be paying more to the bank this time to cover these losses?
The answer is obvious and three-part.
No, yes, it doesn't matter.
Then, please, divide it into three-part.
Why not?
Because the National Central Bank is not an ordinary business.
It can operate with any loss.
It doesn't need money from anyone,
because it creates money on its own, as much as it wants.
Then why not?
Because inflation is stealing from Poles.
And, to put it the most delicately,
an incompetent National Central Bank
is high inflation and economic collapse.
So we will pay for it through other elements,
for example, through inflation.
It's like a policeman at a crossroads,
who is supposed to drive cars.
But if this policeman causes traffic jams and accidents,
it's probably a bad sign,
because he does more harm than good.
In my opinion, this is just such a bad policeman,
our National Central Bank.
And of course, the third part.
So it doesn't matter,
because the National Central Bank is for fighting inflation,
for making profits.
That's why the level of profits or losses
is completely irrelevant
and shouldn't be assessed at all.
During Mr. Adam Glapiński's term,
the National Central Bank had a shockingly high income
from the state budget.
There they showed 35.54 billion in profits.
And even if there is a loss,
it will still be an incredible amount.
The Prime Minister probably wasn't happy,
because such money, several billion,
could always be spent somehow.
But how did it happen?
How could the National Central Bank make losses,
if it doesn't run an economic activity?
Yes, I fully understand your surprise.
Because it sounds idiotic.
Someone has losses,
someone is printing money himself.
Well, funny.
To understand this,
you have to go through a bit of the basic mechanism of macroeconomics.
Debtors issue bonds.
When, for example, there is a panic,
for example, a war,
panic behavior occurs in the stock exchanges.
For example, prices jump rapidly.
What causes the inflation to jump?
Then, interest rates are raised to make it easier.
For example, the National Central Bank Council
has decided to increase the annual interest rate
from 10% to 25% on the 100th day of the invasion.
One time, by 15%!
Indeed, there are shocking moves,
but I'll show you an example,
the most well-known example, the biggest one,
because generally these jumps are at the percent level, etc.
Even 25% is considered a normal regulation.
Here I showed the most well-known, shocking example for economists.
Okay, but what happens next?
After all these moves,
interest rates are increased.
Because, you know, if interest rates are higher,
banks cannot maintain a low interest rate,
because they would lose money on it.
So they raise it.
But all this is only going to the real mechanism.
In order for governments to continue to borrow,
they have to increase the attractiveness of their bonds.
Because who will buy a 2% bond,
when the bank will get a 5% or 20% bond,
like in Ukraine?
It will stop working.
So all financial entities
start overestimating earlier bonds,
i.e. the low interest rate ones,
and everything is fine
until they have to sell these bonds
or wait for the term of their so-called shelf life,
2, 5, 10, 30 years,
because such bonds are actually generated.
However, problems arise
when the bank has to sell old bonds.
That's how the famous Silicon Valley Bank fell.
And that's where the current bank crisis in the USA comes from.
Exactly this mechanism.
And now, central banks,
and all really big financial entities,
are locating their currency reserves,
in Poland it's about 150 billion euros,
in bonds of other countries.
So they are buying these debt papers for each other.
When they have to sell these papers,
they reveal losses,
and that's where the losses of NBP and other central banks come from.
But as I said,
these losses don't matter,
which we have already mentioned earlier.
Mr. Mariusz, let's take a break in the lecture.
We'll be back in a moment.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist, a financial expert,
the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
We're talking about the situation
of the National Bank of Poland.
Mr. Mariusz, one of the sources
of this loss on bonds
was also the misappropriation
of various financial instruments
on international world exchanges.
Should the Central Bank
play on foreign exchanges at all?
""Well, maybe they're doing a trick,""
says President Glapiński,
but it turns out that
these tricks brought a loss.
They invested poorly.
""They're doing a trick,""
he said.
""They're doing a trick,""
I think.
They forget what the law
is supposed to do
and completely fail
their basic duties.
I'm proud of what they shouldn't
be doing.
Out of curiosity,
I've read the entire
Financial Policy Council
and, as far as I remember,
there were no experts
who could prove their expertise
or their economic knowledge.
I remember a doctor of economics
from my university
who never knew how to answer
any questions in class.
We rebelled and stopped
going to classes with this idiot.
The case was brought to the dean
and everyone was charged
to calm the whole affair.
I can only guess how he did his doctorate
because I know many similar cases
of the NBP.
Could it have been predicted
that there would be a loss
on paper or instruments?
Could it have been sold earlier
and invested in gold that would go up?
Of course. Many governments
and investors did exactly that.
Even this crazy, criminal Putin
bought hundreds of tons of gold
before the current crisis.
The Chinese did too.
And everyone made a great financial profit.
Let's get back to the third,
the one you mentioned.
I have a question.
What consequences
could the loss of the NBP bring
to all of us?
Could it be a gold rush?
The consequences will be for Poles
but not because of the loss
we mentioned earlier.
It is a technical, paper loss
and it doesn't matter.
It's a direct loss.
So,
I personally think that
the NBP or the Bolsheviks
are the Egyptian plagues
that are punishing our stupid nation
for the elections we took
literally and figuratively.
I personally think that no politician
should have any influence on our economy.
Will their absurd,
uneconomic,
unwise actions
have a negative impact on us?
Of course. It is absolutely
inevitable.
If we look at the whole policy
of the economy,
we know that it will end badly.
The only question is how
and how much we will pay for it.
We all pay for it.
Even when we go to the store
to get our paychecks.
We all pay for it.
We pay taxes,
we get new taxes.
And as far as I know,
there are absolutely unprotected
new taxes that people don't know about.
I've been following this for years.
I know that there will be new forms
of taxing, quite brutal.
I don't know how the government
will explain it. There will probably be some explanations.
I don't care. I just know
what the economic impact will be.
I know that it's all just a political agenda
that is supposed to make economic decisions.
No, it won't be economic decisions.
It will be political decisions.
And for me as an economist
it is absolutely undisputable.
Mr. Mariusz, the NBP president
is currently earning over a million zlotys,
most of which are various bonuses.
Should he personally be responsible
for the loss of the bank,
or for the high uncontrolled inflation?
And should he lose his bonuses?
I'm not talking about whether he should lose his position
and be replaced by someone else.
No, because he can't do anything.
It's written in his very position.
And as they say,
sooner in India they will show the Holy Cow
than in Poland they will show the High Officer.
This shows the scale of the pathology
of the modern world economy,
full of corrupt, deceitful, unsuccessful people.
An example is Joe Biden from the USA.
He is probably well known to the audience.
And if not, then maybe someday
it will be the subject of the next edition.
We will talk about the subject of the next edition.
For now, a moment of break.
We will be back in a moment
to the subject of the National Bank of Poland.

What is a play?
It is a play with the participation of the economist,
financial expert Mariusz Stefaniak,
the president of the Foundation of More Wisdom,
today on the NBP wallpaper,
and the topic of the famous statements
of President Adam Glapiński,
which sometimes the whole of Poland laughs at.
Do these statements indicate
that he doesn't know about things,
he doesn't know about the things he is talking about?
Or that he is clumsy,
but to accept the way
he tries to explain
some complicated economic issues?
The question is, indeed,
funny statements can be clever,
and a genius expert does not have to be a great speaker
and can make a word play.
And that's totally OK.
His famous statements are,
first of all, not funny,
and stupid, and most importantly,
evidently, partly deceitful.
After the outbreak of the war,
he talked about the so-called inflation rate.
He explained that the price jump
was brought to Poland by high fuel and gas prices.
But now these prices are much lower
than they used to be.
His statement was also deceitful,
and stupid on an even larger scale,
because, as I explained in another
broadcast, after the attack,
Putin sold everything at about 30%
cheaper, and there was even more
going on the market, so according to the rules
of the free market, prices should
drop by as much, but they
increased by 100%
instead of dropping by 30%.
So someone got rich on it,
because I think wars are used for that,
and it's not a good thing.
Yes, but to one of the more controversial
questions, ""is a credit better with a permanent
or a variable rate?"" he answered
that only God can answer this question.
And it's hard not to agree with him.
You have to be a prophet to know what will happen
in 20 or 30 years.
Anyway, the bank wins in every situation
with its client.
I absolutely disagree with that.
That's why I say, for me, these statements
are just stupid.
You know, in this way, let's say,
only God knows.
Do you know about it or not?
Unexpected things can always happen.
But a logically thinking and professional person
knows that there are cars
that are more durable, less
emergency, have better combustion,
etc., etc., etc.
In economics, you also know that there are no miracles.
However, there are some general rules.
If someone is counting on speculative
profits, he should know
the simple rule of investment.
The longer you play in the stock market,
the greater the chance of losing.
This is the simple rule of the casino.
If you go to the casino and bet
any gambling game,
no matter how many times you win,
because the longer you play,
you have an increasing statistical chance
that you will lose everything.
It is impossible to win in the casino
in a long period of time.
You can't hit 10
all the time, it's impossible.
It is said that for the first time
the scale or rate of inflation
in Poland is starting to fall a little.
It can be 14%. Of course,
inflation is still high, but maybe
this is the first sign
that better times are starting.
Maybe President Grafiński was not wrong
that this period of high inflation will end.
There is a saying that even a broken
watch shows the perfect time
twice a day.
For over a year, we have inflation exceeding
10%. Meanwhile, the official
inflationary goal of the NBP in documents
is still 2.5% + - 1%.
This is completely unreal.
Probably for a long time,
maybe the central bank authorities
are conjuring reality.
You can say that they are lying,
that they are not hitting the forecasts,
that they conjure reality. The facts are
that we live in one world,
and the media reports
about the economy are from another world.
I am so happy
from my point of view
that for several months the Council of
Finance has not been raising interest rates,
because I have a loan and I do not have to pay
more and more. I am a little afraid
of the view among economists
that to stop inflation,
interest rates should be higher
than inflation. Is this really
the only way to
control inflation? No, of course not.
This is not the only way, not at all.
This whole debate shows
that either both sides do not know what they are discussing,
or at least one side has no
idea, and the other
deliberately deceives reality and
makes a debate, hiding the truth.
Inflation, sir, is an effect.
Inflation is the fever of a sick organism.
The only sensible
solution is to cure the disease
that causes this fever in you.
And fever, sir, is one of the
best phenomena that the body has.
During fever, pathogens are physically killed.
So lowering the fever
actually helps to develop the disease,
sir. The same in the economy.
Artificial manipulation
with inflation indicators
can only increase
the degeneration of the entire economic system.
High fever also
kills the body. We will not survive
above 42 degrees. You are right.
So inflation and 100%
levels are also bad, but you are talking
about everything in the world.
Let you take any vitamin and take it in large
amounts, you will die. That's why you have to understand
that here in the economy it is not a problem
whether the percentage or the level of inflation
does not matter at all.
It is important whether this economic system
is healthy. Whether the economic system
generates a proper, healthy
supply demand.
Whether it is simply centrally
controlled, communist
monster that will fall for sure,
because it is abnormally
balanced. It is only important
whether our economy is healthy
and whether citizens get rich
or get poorer. Thank you very much
for the conversation, Mr. Mariusz. Let's wish ourselves
health and a healthy economy.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak,
President of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"",
financial economist, and the program
was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Economist, financier, president of the Foundation of More Wisdom, Mariusz Stefaniak,
today we're talking about artificial intelligence and how it can affect the economy.
I read that in the United States, writers and authors of movie scripts will be striking in Hollywood.
Interestingly, they demand not only more money,
but also postulates concerning using artificial intelligence.
When writing scripts, it's rather about not using it.
The fundamental question is whether a machine or artificial intelligence,
something artificial, can write better scripts than people?
Have you ever watched a movie invented by artificial intelligence?
It's funny that you're talking about it, because a few days ago I had the opportunity to write a mini-screenplay
with the use of artificial intelligence.
It was, of course, a test for such a mini-contest, but the effects were satisfactory.
It shows that even the currently operating, available AI creates at the level of ordinary people
and this is almost in every field of art, because we already know about music, we know about painting,
we know about writing, we know about journalism.
According to my knowledge, it is inevitable that AI would become what computers are.
The fool will not use it, the average, but intelligent, can do brilliant things.
Recently, we even had a debate about how students use artificial intelligence
and what impact it can have on education.
What is the point of general education in the era of general use,
for example, from this famous GTP chat, which writes for students, works.
Is there still any point in examining students, if it doesn't give them back their knowledge?
Officially, I saw data that in the USA, 89% of students admit to using the GPT chat,
to do their homework.
Personally, I think it's good that AI will do idiotic and tedious tasks,
saving children time to gain knowledge, not calculations.
How many years do you remember, which you probably spent in school?
I don't know, I never counted it.
Exactly, that's why, please, think about it sometime.
Let him take any book from any subject, opening it and saying,
""God, I don't remember anything, I don't know anything, I've never used it in my life.""
In business, no one will ask you what grades you had in school,
but what you can do and what effects it has.
Encouraging children to learn in school is a guarantee of the average financial status.
Looking through the richest people's lists will clearly show that this is exactly the case.
You were motivated to learn, and I suspect that 99% of students do not have such motivation.
What do they have to have, sir?
What do we need 90% of people after graduation who are, let's face it,
as someone said there, ugly, outcasts?
Because they really can't do anything.
They really are not experts, maybe they don't care at all.
It's not that they're stupid.
If you have to go to school and learn subjects that you are not interested in at all,
you will be bad at it.
At this point, such AI will crush you,
it will eliminate your status to be maintained.
You have no reason to be in the business market.
I was recently at a market, an ordinary market with vegetables.
A guy who sold them to me, it turned out that he was an engineer.
And when I was surprised, he said, ""Look, there's a lawyer selling them at the market.""
Do you understand?
Because they earn more by trading vegetables at the market.
Because law studies, engineering studies, these are good studies, sir.
And the guys prefer to sell at the market.
Why waste a dozen years at school, where you, as we said, 1%, remember?
It's a lot of money spent on the budget.
A lot of the best years of intellectual and physical young people.
A lot of work for teachers, academic lecturers, etc.
It's a huge economic branch.
You're right, it's like a bunch of officials.
People who are unnecessary to us.
Mr. Marysia, we will soon come to the conclusion that most of the work requiring some kind of intellectual commitment
will be done by AI for us, soon or in a moment.
And we will get some physical positions.
Absolutely not.
In my opinion, based on history, for example,
we had a few industrial revolutions, from steam engines to computerization, to mobile phones,
which also changed a lot.
We already know how it works.
There will be a social stratification, sir.
Bigger.
So those who don't do well, for example, with computers, with such modern technologies,
will fall out of business or will be marginalized.
Because their products will be weak.
Their service will be weak.
You will call a company that will have an ordinary list of questions and answers,
which is boring and usually does not answer your question in any way.
And you will have an advanced chatbot that will explain everything to you, etc.
With the peace of mind that you can call and it will not do anything to you.
This company will win.
The second one will lose.
There will be a company that will be able to generate 10,000 articles of a fairly decent class daily.
And the second one will have to hire 100 journalists who will produce a thousand articles of different quality.
Which one do you think will exist in 5 years and which one will disappear from the market?
This is obvious.
These are such crushing data, sir.
When I look at the stock charts of individual companies, it is totally crushingly unambiguous for me.
I claim that this will not ruin any disaster, but will simply make a greater social stratification.
Financial, economic.
Mr. Mariusz, we will come back to this interesting thread after the break.

What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
The economist, the financial expert, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation, Mariusz Stefaniak,
today we are talking about artificial intelligence and how it can affect the economy.
You mentioned that we have some historical experience in competition with machines.
From history we know that in the 18th century in England, during the Industrial Revolution,
workers destroyed steam engines because they were afraid that they would lose their jobs.
After 200 years, it turns out that the industry is developing all the time, there is no shortage of work.
So maybe there is nothing to be afraid of, as you have already started to explain.
You know what? We have something to be afraid of, but not what most people think.
I'm listening to the father of artificial intelligence, that's what they call him.
A man who just left Google, officially the best employer in the world,
where for 10 years he became a millionaire every year and had benefits he had never seen before.
He left to be able to freely talk about AI dangers.
This is literally a quote from his words, translated from English, of course.
He calls for increased awareness of the bad use of AI by criminals and special services.
Those people who work with it and are really at a high level, they are terrified of what they see.
You know what? However, artificial intelligence remains a tool in all of this.
Perfect or striving for perfection, but a tool like a knife that can be used for good and bad purposes.
There are always good people and bad people who use all kinds of tools to do good or bad things.
So basically he didn't discover anything new.
You know what? You're right, but imagine a criminal with a knife and a criminal with a nuclear bomb.
Yes, but so far we have managed to keep this nuclear bomb for 50 or 60 years under control.
But what an effort. These are not easy things.
I personally see powerful threats, but not where people see them.
They don't say that they will be unemployed there, but I claim, based on my professional knowledge
and historical knowledge, which we have documented very, very carefully,
that AI will not destroy humanity economically, it will not deprive us of work,
it will only dramatically transform our lifestyle, make the rich richer and the poor poorer.
But will there ever come a time when artificial intelligence becomes self-sufficient in production?
All the time, however, there is still a man in the background who programs certain things, imposes, defines,
and artificial intelligence only adapts to these questions.
When will it happen that it will determine its goals and implement them?
I have no idea and I hope never.
Because I don't see any benefit from it at all, and I see a lot of minuses.
I personally think, but I'm not an AI expert, I have a sense of it,
that it's funny, because now when we talk, we're doing a project in my foundation,
where we build our own AI models and we're going to implement certain projects with the help of such AI projects.
So let's say that we also play with the latest technologies on a small scale,
we test them and try to experiment with them in a small way and use them for good, meaningful purposes.
Because this is a tool, as you said, like any other, that a smart person will not take a knife and run around the house,
trading and murdering people. Only fanatics, idiots and frustrated people will do that.
A smart person will make a good use of it, good for himself and for others.
And I perceive AI this way.
Of course, you have to be aware that it is a dangerous tool, especially in the hands of dangerous people.
For example, corporations, which can deceive you very much, creating such a realistic illusion of reality,
that you will not be able to defend yourself against it in any way.
We are talking about special services, which can manipulate, blackmail people,
creating false evidence that cannot be distinguished from the real ones.
Because video material is video material, you cannot distinguish it.
Who created it? At this level, it is already starting to emerge.
We are talking about such voice manipulation, that the closest ones are not able to distinguish
whether it is said by AI or your beloved relative, who will call and say ""pay up, because they keep a minus on the throat"" etc.
Do you understand? We are talking about such situations. This is happening today.
Mr. Mariusz, we still have a few questions about AI, but we will return to this topic after the break.

What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Our topic is AI and its impact on the economy and the future of the world.
We are talking to Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist, a financial expert, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Mr. Mariusz, from the point of view of such an average user, for example, of this famous chat, which helps to write various types of work,
I ask a question and in some way I am editing the topic, and AI does all the work for me.
But what guarantees do I have that the work I got, the information that it prepared for me, is well-developed,
that this information is true, that it meets my needs and my questions, and not someone else trying to smuggle something
to influence what I buy, what I buy, what choices I make in the store or at the polling station.
Do we have such guarantees?
We have 100% guarantees that what you get will definitely be manipulated.
The question is only in what form.
There is a very nice mechanism described by experts in this field, where AI fantasizes, just invents things.
So I also tested the latest solutions, the most sophisticated artificial intelligence in the world.
And I will be honest, I even managed to reach the limits of its knowledge a few times,
I managed to deceive it, force it to do things it didn't want to do, it had a programming blockade to not do it,
I managed to deceive it to do it.
So you can do things, even if AI has programmed it not to do it.
So I confirm you, you will definitely be lied to, things will definitely be invented,
and scientists are not able to deal with it at all, there is not even an idea how to do it.
Because what does AI do if it doesn't know any answers? It just makes them. It makes scientific research, it makes publications,
it creates facts out of nothing, so that what it says makes sense.
Why do we need something that deceives us?
I also wondered about this topic.
If you thought deeply and looked for yourself in the so-called social sciences, you would learn one thing.
People are notoriously deceiving each other.
Every intelligence leads by two paths, the path of deception and the path of truth.
The path of deception is a very fast and profitable path in a short time,
the path of truth is a difficult and profitable path only in the long run.
So don't be surprised that AI does it too, because it is intelligence.
I will return to the future of the economy, to the role of man in the economy of the future.
The economy needs not only the supply of goods, which AI and machines can probably provide,
but it also needs demand, i.e. consumers, i.e. a man.
A man who can afford to buy various things, who is able to pay.
But if people are driven by AI, for example, from professions such as architect, journalist, screenwriter,
who will buy what AI produces?
It's not like that, sir. I'll give you an example, because it's best on examples.
Do you know that, paradoxically, the biggest customers of Nike and other expensive sports shoes
were not rich white athletes, but the poorest of the black slums of the USA,
who often steal, and even kill, bought the latest shoes for hundreds of dollars.
And I assume that you have never bought such shoes as they did.
There were great protests and it just turned out who is the biggest customer of the richest sports companies.
The poorest buy the most expensive things?
Exactly. And here we come back to AI and industrial revolutions.
In my opinion, AI will lead to the emergence of a gigantic new class of white men.
If you went to Africa, which is a really incredibly poor continent,
you would find out that they have the latest cell phones.
Mud houses and you have cell phones. You have iPhones, you have iPads.
People have no idea that in slums people can have better phones than they do.
People who consider themselves to be white, middle class, in the first practically level of civilizational development.
This economy is not so black and white that we will say, ""Oh, it's good here, it's bad here, they're poor, they're rich.""
No, it doesn't look like that, sir. It's much more complex and more dynamic.
It's not like the richest people who have all these Amazons, Google and the biggest companies in the world,
they want to sell only to the well-off middle class.
No, it's exactly the opposite. Rich companies want to have poor customers.
Because a poor customer, sir, usually has little awareness,
so one cool campaign with a favorite athlete is enough and suddenly BOOM! Sales shock.
And the gentleman will wonder, ""Okay, what are the features? Is it worth it?
Are you checking some parameters? Are you checking the warrants?""
They don't care about it. They don't care at all.
Because it doesn't matter to him whether the shoes cost 100, 200, 500 dollars,
because he still has to buy it.
You have to work on it, you have to put it off.
And the company that sells these products, unfortunately, brutally speaking, it doesn't matter
if someone will murder for these shoes or work hard on it.
The economy is brutal.
It's also time for a brutal one. Thank you for this conversation, because in my opinion it was very interesting.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation,
German company Wiesmann, which is very well known on our market for years,
has been building a heat pump factory in Legnica for a year.
It spent 200 million euros on it, so the investment is serious.
A few years ago, the heat pump was not in our homes.
Today, there are 320,000 of them installed,
and hundreds more are installed in new buildings.
The price of the heat pump has skyrocketed.
Today it is 30,000 zlotys and without installation.
Basically, it is a gold interest.
Meanwhile, the strangest thing is that Wiesmann
sold to the American company Central Global.
What's the point?
Yes, let me think. I will add that this is not a special case,
but part of a larger scheme.
But first, let's draw some facts.
1. We know that the officials at the highest levels of power are scammers.
2. We know that there are multinational, national megacorporations
with unimaginably large amounts of money.
3. Most people never check what they are told.
4. People are sensitive to emotional and well-sounding things,
such as security, environment, children's future, etc.
5. Most mega-rich people have small or even no scruples
when they can earn more than they currently have.
Since we already have a few facts, we can move on to the analysis of your question.
At the same time, officials around the world have begun to introduce regulations
taking care of the environment, our health and the future of our children.
And quite by chance, this is the best business
for one or more world giants
who have patents, money and production facilities
for one or more technologies necessary to meet these regulations.
A classic example from our backyard is the Climate Package 2020.
It was invented in 2007 and introduced in 2009.
It assumed a cut of 20% of greenhouse gas emissions,
an increase of 20% of renewable energy sources
and a 20% increase in energy efficiency.
This is brilliant for an industry that has literally never existed before.
I was not even able to find data on the existence of heat pumps in Poland in 2010
and sales data.
It was just some non-existent, symbolic, individual thing.
Now we are talking about heat pumps.
Let me remind you of a few facts again.
Heat pumps have existed for over 200 years and date back to Kelvin,
this Kelvin from the degree.
In 1852, the possibility of using a heat pump for heating was already known.
In 1912, a patent was made for ground heat pumps.
And there is such a patent issued, it is a Swiss patent.
- 100 years ago.
- Over 100 years ago.
In the 1930s, heat pumps were already being used in a continuous and daily way.
And nothing, as if there was no explosion, there was no mega-business,
these were scandalous little things.
In 2010, 6,500 all types of heat pumps were officially sold in Poland.
And in 2022, 200,000.
You see, after introducing the regulations of this climate package,
suddenly a few thousand appeared.
How much will you earn on these few thousand heat pumps if you are a mega-rich man?
Nothing.
But for 200,000, yes.
And it's really gigantic.
If you look at the charts of the industry development, it's just a peak.
This is only the golden business.
This is just the beginning of this Eldorado.
And now you understand that if we combine all the things I said earlier,
that is, that we will buy over the office, we know that,
that rich companies even finance campaign of politicians and officials of various levels,
that they get the right positions,
and that something that did not exist before the introduction of the regulations
suddenly shot up after the introduction of these regulations,
which were introduced by officials who were financially,
I'm not saying that everyone, I'm not saying that everyone, I'm not saying that always,
but enough a lot and in high enough positions to change the face of the world.
So I hope that answers the question,
why yes and why even a bigger giant bought a very large company anyway.
And I invite you for a moment of break.
We'll be back to the subject.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
As an economist, a financier, the president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom""
today the subject is climate packages.
You were talking about the package ""20-20"", but in front of us is the package ""Fit for 55"",
which is even higher carbon dioxide reduction standards.
This package has recently started to be spoken about more loudly in Polish media,
also, primarily because it will be very expensive for society.
But from what you say, it shouldn't be a surprise
for people who just know about it.
Didn't politicians realize it?
They realized it perfectly.
For me, this is another revelation of the mega-business known to us in this package ""20-20"".
Of course, the goal refers to a reduction of emissions by at least 55% by 2030.
I will make you laugh, because I saw the documents of the European Commission,
special sub-commission of the European Commission,
which plans - attention - installation of 30 million heat pumps by 2030.
Do you remember the number I mentioned earlier?
Now it will be 30 million in the EU itself.
This is only business.
Not a few thousand on the scale of a 30-million nation,
but we are talking about tens, or maybe hundreds of millions of such pumps,
which, as you rightly noticed, are often raised in price several times.
You would have to look at the officials who introduced it.
Why did they introduce it and what it really is about.
Mr. Mariusz, but on the other side of this whole legal machine, there are millions of people in Poland.
And usually the poorest people have the easiest heating methods.
We have 5 million coal or wood furnaces in Poland.
One and a half million chimneys or so-called ""kuz"",
i.e. furnaces already completely simple for coal and wood.
Well, it may concern a dozen or more than 20 million people.
Where are they suddenly going to get 30,000 zlotys or more for the purchase of a heat pump and for installing it in their home?
It's easy. They have to sell their houses.
And I assume that this is exactly what these regulations are about.
Well, I don't think they will agree to it so easily, but it's already on the margin.
I think they won't have a way out and no one will ask for a sentence.
This is a saying, they will have as much to talk about as the Jews of the occupation.
We talked about this mechanism.
A rich company, a bribe-taking official, and in the end people who have nothing to say.
They will tell you that you have an unproperly insulated, unproperly insulated, unproperly heated house.
And you will get such sanctions, such payments, such penalties,
that you will either owe 30 more years to meet these standards to live in your own house, to make it funnier.
Or you will just sell this house and live with someone who meets these standards,
because he is a mega-rich corporation that has hundreds of billions of dollars.
And especially since they produce these things themselves,
so they will have it at the expense of production, i.e. for a penny, for a fraction of the price.
And you will just be someone's slave, because you will have to work it out.
Well, it's not just about people who live in single-family houses and who have to provide heating themselves.
The same goes for this Fitfor55 package, it will affect the price of network heat, the price of energy.
I remember a year ago when I was talking to the president of a heating company in the town of Prudnik,
who was personally sorry because he had to raise the price of heat by 45%.
He knew that most of his customers are just unmarried people.
How will it affect network heat?
All that is happening now, this is the answer.
You have a few elements.
Element number one is the production of heat energy, which we produce ourselves, individually and in the form of domestic production.
Second, you have the production and import of energy from abroad, in the form of, for example, coal ore to the power plant, etc.
And you have the third element of the layout, i.e. the entire technology, technical infrastructure,
which, in quotation marks, will increase energy efficiency, etc.
Efficiency, better glass, better insulation, heat pumps, photovoltaic installations, fans, water power plants.
A lot of technology that is now being used by our beloved office.
So if you think that all these elements are subject to any market law,
then think again and look at the facts.
It's all controlled by so-called lobbyists,
i.e. people who change the regulations for money so that they are beneficial to their shareholders.
You will see that such people officially appear in almost every government I know of.
It should be illegal, not that you are burning a fireplace, etc.
If you ever wanted to devote one day to opening documentation,
for example, the climate package for 2020 or the FIT 55,
you would see that the goals themselves are idiotic assumptions.
If all people in the entire EU reduced all emissions to zero, including exhaust air,
literally, it would be impossible to measure it in any way.
This is the minimum impact.
So who creates this pollution?
All these emissions, etc.
Gas, waste, for example, China, where, which is funny,
almost all devices are produced, these are heat pumps, electric car batteries, fans, panels.
All this is produced where there are no rules, regulations, limits.
Not only that, the things that are supposed to reduce this pollution are produced by the one who produces this pollution.
90%
What's the point, please explain to me, because I don't see any point in it.
Mr. Mariusz, our listeners need a break.
I invite you to continue after the break.
Thank you.
The end
The end
What's the point, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"".
Today we are thinking about the issues of financial, economic and ecological challenges that are ahead of us.
Mr. Mariusz, when I was talking to a representative of this industry, I heard a very beautiful vision.
How can it be in a few years or a dozen years when we will become self-sufficient,
energetically, because every house will produce energy, solar panels,
it will accumulate, maintain, for example, in batteries, a car standing in the garage
and we will simply be independent, energetic.
Such a vision is ahead of us, maybe it is worth just trying hard for such a vision.
Do you believe that it is at all to be fulfilled?
It's a beautiful myth, unfortunately only for the naive.
The problem is very technologically complex, especially that the regulations interfere with the acquisition of independence.
They even prevent the acquisition of such independence, because technologically we would be able to do it.
From the point of view of the regulations, however, it will be totally unattainable.
Moreover, already now, additional payments have been introduced for users,
so the producers of the healthiest energy, the so-called green energy.
They are burdened with additional payments for producing the best possible energy,
according to the European Union and other such bodies of legislation, but they are punished with payments.
They were persuaded to install it and spend their own money on it.
Yes, they were persuaded in many ways, you are right, but in order for them to be literally slaves now.
I don't know if you know, but the latest system, as it was introduced,
the energy distribution for these prosumers, i.e. those who are at the same time consumers,
such normal people, and at the same time produce this ecological variety of energy.
Depending on what time you produce this energy, we will give you a different price.
It sounds cool, oh, market rules, how cool it will be, you can probably earn more.
And you know that in some hours they get one penny.
Theoretically, according to the model that is in the regulations, people can pay more for producing and sending electricity to the network.
Wait, I have this property that I developed and built myself, and I do it, I service it, and so on.
So I have to pay for it? No, no, no, no, we will do it so that the highest will be zero.
We are good for you, okay? So he will get zero for it.
What are you supposed to do with a few megawatts of energy that you will produce on a sunny day?
When someone tells you that we will take this energy from you, but you will get zero?
But if you want to use the energy from the network in the evening, you will pay 1, 2, 3, 5 zlotys.
Because we can set the price we want.
After all, you know, variable rates, free market, right?
Only one side sets these rates.
And in my opinion, it will go exactly in this direction.
So you will have control, the inspector will come to you and say ""Hmm, this pump, no, no, it can no longer be serviced, serviced.""
And you have a penalty of 10,000 zlotys until you replace it with a new factor, just those mega corporations we were talking about.
Because only they produce it.
No one in the garage will do it.
You fall into a trap.
You would like to be eco, you would like to be independent, and you are a slave to another bunch of officials that you keep to yourself.
And the environment will not notice it, sir, because the global amount does not fall at all.
Because to produce these eco things, we have to pollute the environment so much that we have pollution for a few or sometimes a dozen years ahead.
As if we had the usual, these combustion, the worst diesels that are now hated by all governments and all legislators.
Mr. Mariusz, but if we manage to technologically solve the problem of energy storage, because we now have a period of overproduction of green energy,
well, maybe we will go through this stage and we will be so safe, so secure, so ecological, that the whole situation will finally pay off and will work.
You know what? I know the topic of energy storages quite well.
Recently, I verified, I hope quite thoroughly, the technologies available in the world in this area.
And I will tell you one thing.
Only a few companies in the world produce things for energy storages.
Again, we fell into the same trap.
Oligopols, that's what it's called professionally.
That is, a few big ones that control almost the entire market, and those little ones are so insignificant that there is nothing to talk about.
Therefore, if you want to do it, you have a choice of a few technologies, a few producers.
And they dictate the price to you, if there is something like that, and there will be a requirement, I don't know, energy storage, because you can't just throw it away.
Now people can possibly turn off the whole installation.
So stay without and again be 100% dependent on any price of energy.
Not only that, if they don't get out of the limits of how much they have to pay, they also pay for it.
Do you understand?
This is a brilliant system.
I am impressed by the geniuses who came up with such a trap, such a trap for flies, sir.
The flies themselves pay to get into the trap.
Thank you very much for the interview.
Our guest was the economist, financier Mariusz Stefaniak.
And I once again remind you of the phone number under which we are waiting for questions, for suggestions from our listeners.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is a financial economist,
the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Our guest is not the first time,
anyway, today we are discussing the demography and economy of Germany.
I heard that the German government and the city of Gerlitz
are inviting foreigners to visit them.
It's a border town, so the offer is probably mainly aimed at Poles.
And what do they offer in this Gerlitz?
Well, they offer a rent cover for the apartment for the first two months.
In addition, for three months, a free ticket to public transport.
If someone offers me something for free,
I'll immediately blow a trap.
What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz? What's the matter?
Yes, it's really funny, but at the same time scandalously offensive for Poles.
They give us a bus ticket?
Let's take a look at what they give to others.
For refugees from Ukraine, and there are over a million of them,
they give exactly the same privileges as the German citizens,
but bigger than all other migrants.
A salary of 449 euros for each,
and up to 400 euros for children, depending on the age.
So a typical Ukrainian family
gets several thousand euros per month for entry.
But that's not all.
The authorities pay for the costs of housing, rent, heating and cold water.
They also have various aid activities for other gas and electricity bills.
The government has given 4.4 billion euros last year to Ukrainians alone,
and additionally finances various social services for them.
And so I looked at it again, that only 9% of Ukrainians live in refugee centers,
three-quarters live in private homes.
Almost 40% intends to stay forever, or at least for a few years.
I also saw the news of the Minister of the Interior,
which reveals that a large number of Ukrainian youth
is being transferred to high crime.
Now there are officially almost 4,000 such crimes,
where there were several hundred cases in all of Germany before.
I encourage Poles to see the police statistics in Poland,
and be surprised that Polish criminals are declining in the number and brutality of crimes.
Well, Mr. Maryszula, but this is help for refugees from a country engulfed in war.
In a sense, it can be understood.
But why invite and give such privileges to refugees from Poland?
Why so much emigration for Germans?
Because there is no one to work.
Perhaps this is a problem of the eastern countries,
which for years, decades, have been part of the GDR.
In relation to the western Germany, they are late.
And it seems that after the merger, a large part of the Germans from the east simply moved to the west.
Does this problem concern the whole country, all of Germany, or only the eastern part?
So yes, of course, you are right that it was so, after the merger of Germany, indeed.
And to this day, if someone travels through Germany and looks around carefully,
he sees as if he was driving through two levels.
The poor level and the rich level.
The economy, the city, everything is poorer on the eastern side.
This is really the case to this day.
Of course, this is significantly blurred by all the decades that have passed since the merger.
It's true, but it's still visible to the naked eye.
The only problem is not that it is historically poorer or historically richer.
The problem is that, as I said, there is no one to work in Germany.
According to my estimates, in Germany, the least people work,
and the most income in the history of this country.
We officially know that the so-called refugees have been influenced by the multi-million-dollar Reich.
And what a miracle it can be that many millions of young healthy people enter the country,
because I checked the statistics, and the average refugee is 29.9,
and the average German is 47 and something.
So this is a gigantic, crushing age difference.
Those refugees who came from the south-east are young, healthy, strong people.
And we're talking about multi-million things here.
They were not able to provide the economy with the right amount of jobs.
As the German Internal Affairs Office officially states,
this is a gigantic multi-billion.
If I remember, I once summed it up, we're talking about tens of billions of euros spent on all kinds of benefits.
Someone has to earn it.
The Germans can't, there are too few of them, they are old, this is a country of pensions and practically no children.
Who will work? Poles? And we have to work for a bus ticket?
When the Ukrainian family gets thousands of euros for free accommodation, for paying the front?
This is offensive.
We'll come back to the topic of German demographics and the demographic effects of Germany after the break.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest today is a financial economist, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Our guest, not for the first time, today we are discussing the demographics and economy of Germany.
A broad topic.
Mr. Mariusz, I also reached for statistical data and 10 years ago, 3 million people lived in Germany.
It has increased a lot in a situation where Germans are generally not born.
What benefits do German immigrants bring to the economy?
Because basically, the more people, the better for the economy. Does it work?
No, it definitely doesn't work, because the question itself is formulated wrongly.
It captures the years of manipulation that we have gone through over the last 10 years.
What does that mean?
Let's ask the right question.
Who benefits from the fact that Germans have about 20 million inhabitants and many of them are kept on permanent basis?
These are not ordinary immigrants who came there to work, live and so on.
To assimilate with the German society.
This is a wave that is completely unusual in the history of emigration in general in the world, really.
A great case study would be the analysis of the waves of emigration in the United States and the impact on the economy,
because we have brilliant data, fantastic analysis over the last few decades.
And you could actually reach even the first Irish or African who were there and see how it affected over the centuries.
And then you have the future of Europe on the plate.
We know what will happen in Europe, what consequences it will bring and what effects we will have in 10, 20, 50 years.
It is practically obvious if you have economic knowledge and minimal historical data,
for example from the United States, which are my brilliant case study on this.
Mr. Mariusz, but the alternative is bad, because the Germans have not wanted to give birth for years.
The birth rate is very low there.
The natural growth among Germans is very small, in fact, it does not exist.
Despite the fact that social programs support childbirth, help, encourage and create good conditions for having children.
Well, if the Germans themselves are not able to develop, what is the alternative?
Besides accepting immigrants.
Here again I would take a case study, for example, Japan, because we have brilliant data again.
They are ready, developed, we know what will happen in a few years.
If there is no childbirth in society, there is always a reason for it.
Nothing is taken for granted, nothing is taken for granted.
So why don't Germans have children?
Well, a similar question can be asked in Poland, because in Poland the birth rate is also very low.
It seems to me that the reason is also civilizational changes.
Young women do not want to give birth to children, they have a different lifestyle.
Bravo!
All this is, of course, brutally clear when you look at the most important factors affecting,
first of all, the social system, and secondly the economy of a given country.
When do people want to have many children?
When does it benefit them?
And they must have a sense of security.
If you have a sense of security because you know that you will be in charge,
that you will have a guardian, that you will have a great pension, and so on,
suddenly, ""Why do I need five children? I can have one?
Or in general, because it is tiring, annoying, there are duties, so why do I need children at all? ""
When will you have an alternative, that in fact, ""Listen, if you don't take care of yourself,
you will breathe in loneliness, old, sick, poor, and so on,
then I have to have people who will take care of me, my future, financial, health, back, and so on.
Because I don't do the shopping myself, I don't clean the apartment myself, I don't keep it myself,
I won't have anyone to talk to.
If you have an alternative, that you can get it all,
then why should you do this more difficult way?
Because let's face it, raising children is a duty.
And attention, a gigantic expense.
We are talking here about such data, that maintaining a child until the adult age is, for example, half a million zlotys.
If I have four children, I have to spend two million?
If you want to raise them properly, keep them, and so on, then two million is not an exaggerated amount.
What happens in such a case, when a person is undereducated, poor, and so on?
He doesn't think, he doesn't think, he just has sex, he doesn't think about the consequences,
because it doesn't really matter in terms of raising a multi-child family,
that there are three, five, or fifteen children, it doesn't really matter.
That's why the idiocy of all these subsidies is that someone gives for every child.
You have no idea about the economy, you have no idea about sociology, you have no idea about family life.
Such things can only be done by complete idiots.
Because it's not one-to-one.
It has never been like that in the history of the world, and probably never will be.
That's why if things were done properly, it would all look different.
And these subsidies would look different, and suddenly it would turn out that these poor people would not want to have fifteen children,
because then their, in a word, ""profits"", yes, from these children, would fall.
Because the expense for the next child is an additional portion of groceries, or whatever they will be doing,
which probably gives a penny in costs, and the profit is gigantic.
But such a thinking, educated, conscious man, he will not calculate that you will make five more children,
because they came and they were afraid of thousands a month.
You will never make such a decision.
Mr. Mariusz, let's take a break, we'll be back to the subject in a moment.

What is played, Mr. Mariusz?
The economist, the financier, the president of the Foundation for More Wisdom, Mariusz Stefaniak,
today we are talking about demography and the economy.
About how it all connects, influences each other.
From our previous conversation and from what you are saying, it turns out that if we eliminate the pension system,
it will end up with an increase in childbirth, because people will have to have children who will take care of them for old age.
Yes, it would work that way for sure.
In addition, please note that the pension system is just a bullet in the neck of every budget of every country.
Well, the expenses for retirement are huge and are growing.
It is impossible to keep it in the composition, at least in Poland.
There is no such possibility.
In practically no known and modern country, this system is not balanced, to put it shortly.
The system itself is badly designed, because it assumed that there will always be an increase in the population,
there will be more of this population that works than the one that takes care of the food.
Experience says that it is accurate.
On the contrary, not only that, with this migration that you mentioned, it is already scandalously bad,
because suddenly 1, 2, 3, 5 million people who take care of the food, but do not work and do not even intend to work in most cases.
In addition, it produces children who will not work either, because what for, if you can survive without work?
Mr. Mariusz, but let's assume such a completely hypothetical situation,
that in Poland we are liquidating the social care system and the retirement system,
in fact, we have a lot of children, more children.
But in a situation where we have well-developed social states in the neighborhood,
these young people, this demographic rise simply moves to neighboring Germany,
where it fills that gap and uses that social care.
Bravo! You have just described all these migration crises in Europe.
So we have a limited impact on reality, even if we make deep reforms.
No, we have a very big impact on reality if we controlled our own country.
Well, yes, but you know, always, at least for many centuries,
Europe will be a much more developed continent than, for example, Africa.
It is clear and obvious that people are drawn to countries that are better developed,
where you can get a better job, not only social support decides about it.
As if you lived in some place and you had a poor neighbor's estate nearby.
And you want to tell me that you have a nice salon,
this is the reason they massively put you in a house and live there, really?
Well, not quite.
Well, that's exactly what it's about, because there is no other method, sir.
We wonder if it is at all possible to eliminate the pension system in Poland
and get people used to state care going so far.
Let's take a book about history and see how many centuries humanity has been developing great without pension systems.
Well, the pension system is probably a 19th century invention, as far as I remember, so we have it for less than 200 years.
Certainly, society works great without pension systems.
Moreover, these are the times of the greatest development.
Everything in excess, even the wisest thing, is harmful.
I'm not saying that any form of care for the elderly, the sick, the disabled is bad.
Because if you took the same books to history and saw them again,
such systems have always existed for centuries.
Even in tribal systems, I don't know if you know that in most cultures there was no concept of orphans.
Well, the family was primarily concerned with orphans.
Exactly, because there was a social system that made all children, in quotation marks, ""adopted"" from power
and no one ever treated them worse because it was so ordinary.
Not only that, in many cultures, including Jewish, there was no concept of widow at all.
If her husband died, the husband's brother had a duty to take her as his wife.
There are no abandoned women, no widows, no orphans. It's that simple.
Why do we need artificial pensions that only encourage people to not work,
to combine, to get artificial pensions, etc.?
Normally, a person would look for how to keep up.
And now, how to make them write to me that they can't get a job at all?
Because it pays off more.
These systems only cause corruption.
On the one hand, officials, because the more the group of officials grows,
it's a hand for politicians, because then they put all their cumulatives
on great positions from which no one will ever count them.
Because how to count someone who works in ZUS, sir?
According to what?
Mr. Mariusz, but the last 150 years,
that is, the period of commitment of pensions systems,
is at the same time a period when the length of average life has increased a lot,
when health care has increased a lot,
the quality of life has improved, we live better, we eat more.
Doesn't it mean that if we eliminate the pension system,
that we will go back with all these achievements and suddenly we will be poorer,
we will not travel so much, visit, eat so well, rest so well?
You are right. For the moment, yes.
Because if you want to bring something back to balance,
you have to devote a momentary pleasure, comfort,
for the long-term benefit, for the benefit of your children,
for the benefit of the country for the next decades.
If you want to fix a car, you have to make it run,
but if you don't fix the car, you'll kill yourself in it, sir.
I understand, but I don't know if it's not a therapy so painful that it can kill some patients.
I don't think so, because it will definitely kill some patients what it is now.
Because a large number of unemployed is a great crime.
It physically kills.
You can do a simple thing, that those who are already in this system,
will live, die, etc., but no one new will enter this system.
You won't get super benefits, you can get free soup in the kitchen of your brother Albert.
If you have an alternative, that you will get a few hundred euros a month for free,
then why should you try, work, study at night, etc.?
There is no need for that.
If you will eat a bowl of soup, that you won't die of hunger only,
and you will live in a dormitory,
I don't want such a life, of course, some people will go like that.
But these are minimal costs of maintenance, sir.
These are pennies compared to the pension system.
Okay, we can afford it, sir.
We are talking about billions, that are being spent at this moment.
This whole system is absurd.
Most of the pensions have some real estate and savings.
What is the problem, that they didn't pass it on,
only that if your parents won't keep you, we will take your house, right?
For the cost of this maintenance.
Here you go, I will keep your standard of living,
but you give me those villas, fields, plots, etc.
No problem, here you go.
And suddenly your parents say, no, no, no, we will keep this grandmother,
but we will take over the apartment for her.
Okay, fair, no problem, keep this grandmother.
There are so many solutions, that you will be able to choose directly from the solutions.
And you think, which is better, which is worse, what are the advantages, what are the disadvantages.
I can't imagine a situation, where there would be some big tragedy,
mass starvation, deaths on the streets.
Now, in this system, sir, the pensioners are starving.
Because there are high payments, high medical bills.
Yes, the pensioners are starving, of course, no one makes a problem out of it.
Mr. Mariusz, we have to put a dot in this very interesting conversation,
but I hope that there will be an opportunity to come back to this topic.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial advisor,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation, and the conversation was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.
Thank you very much for the conversation, see you soon.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz? Our guest is the economist, financier Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
I would like us to talk about beer today, although without fear that we will advertise alcohol on the radio.
It's rather about anti-advertising American beer, which is called ""Boot Light"" and is produced by Budweiser, which is also well known in Poland.
Recently, the ad for this beer appeared with an American influencer, who is a transvestite, i.e. someone who has changed their sex.
And this influencer is now making a career, and millions of people follow her profile on various social media.
The effect of this ad was the opposite of what was intended. The beer was supposed to sell better, and its sales fell, the manufacturer itself states that by 25% officially.
What happened, Mr. Mariusz, that Americans suddenly stopped enjoying the ""Boot Light"" beer?
Good question, and maybe to answer it, let's start with a few facts.
First, this infamous performance took place on April 1, ""Nomen omen, Fool's Day"".
Secondly, you actually used the word ""transvestite"", because it means exactly diagnosing medical disorders, including mental health disorders.
And in the international ICD classification, this disorder is classified as a gender-identifying disorder.
Thirdly, this man was a ""homosexualist"" for years.
I checked this with a license from a colleague of stage and media art, and when he was an unemployed actor during the pandemic, he came up with the idea of ​​being a woman.
What he himself says, currently this man makes millions pretending to be a woman.
Okay, let's move on to our beer. We are talking about a company here that has over 100 countries, over 400 well-known beer brands and controls almost 30% of the world's beer production.
Another fact, ""Boot Light"" is the best selling beer in the USA, and it's been for years.
It was.
Well, yes, sorry, my mistake. It was the best selling beer in the USA for years and it was liked by so-called ""rednecks"", which, translating into our language, ""peasants"", although it does not quite reflect what a ""redneck"" is in the USA.
But generally they are characterized by a simple lifestyle, traditional views and the fact that they do not come from big cities and are not super modern, groundbreaking, typical Americans from outside big cities.
But do these typical Americans have any problems, any dislike for transgender people?
No, they absolutely have no dislike.
So what upset them in this ad?
Well, that's a good question. As I have seen many specialist comments, practically no one answered wisely.
What is the real answer, in my opinion?
Because these people felt cheated.
For all the years, all the beers were launched by ""sexual girls in bikinis"" with guys being somewhere at matches, picnics, with the USA flag somewhere in the air.
And it was like that for all the years.
Suddenly someone throws it in the trash, suddenly hangs a rainbow flag instead of an American one, with a guy pretending to be a woman.
Hello! We haven't had such a beer for years!
It's worse than if they poured ordinary water into these bottles, because suddenly they pumped in extreme politics and extreme leftist ideology here.
What is important, even half of the leftists in the USA do not accept.
So what is introduced here in this ad, even the left itself rejects as something absurd, senseless, harmful.
And that's why it was such a shock for the entire American population, for the American majority.
Mr. Maryszula, but the ads you mentioned earlier, used by the producer of this beer, i.e. ads with beautiful and, let's say, sexy women,
are now treated as unwanted, sexist ads, which present women in an inappropriate way.
You're right, indeed. That's what they explain, at least.
Of course, it's a lie, because the fact that a woman is sexy and attractive and arouses desire in men is not a bad thing, nor a terrible thing, nor a degrading woman.
On the contrary, it is her greatest strength, her attractiveness, her advantage.
Presenting it as something bad is simply a misunderstanding of the nature of people, the role of women in the world.
Even a misunderstanding is a deliberate degeneration, in my opinion. Because I don't believe that people don't know it, because it's too obvious facts not to know it.
I invite you to a short break, we'll be back to this topic in a moment.

What's up, ladies and gentlemen? Our guest is the economist, financier Mariusz Stefaniak, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we're talking about how not to make mistakes when advertising certain products.
That's right, a mistake! Mr. Mariusz, the management of the American Budweiser could have expected that their main recipient, the ""Rednecks"" you mentioned, could react like that to the new ad.
It's a mistake! It's just a mistake for which someone should be held responsible. Could they have expected it or not?
No, absolutely not. It's absolutely not a mistake.
So what is it? How to call it?
It's a detachment of the left-wing governments of the megacorporation, especially those media decision-makers, who are now almost entirely political, ideological activists, not specialists.
They literally live in a fictional world that has nothing to do with the life of normal people.
But who chooses them for the leadership positions if they are guided by ideology, not economy?
Very good question. The answer to this question will bring us closer to solving the whole mystery.
I'm listening carefully.
The point is how modern corporations work.
People think that they live on the money earned by their clients and that these clients are the ones who maintain these corporations.
I'm sorry, but it's not true.
I'm not talking about ordinary, local, national enterprises, because they still work according to the old economic system.
But all international megacorporations have a completely new operating system.
This means that the money for their operation comes from outside, from outside these companies.
So they can't sustain themselves.
If these companies were left to earn only what they earn from the market from their clients, I guarantee you that after a few days there would be no company on the world's top ten.
But this is from outside, so where do the sources of financing these companies come from?
And that's the whole secret.
There are practically two main ways to get money for companies on the market.
One - getting it from investors.
The second - borrowing, drawing out loans.
Mr. Mariusz, you are talking about a huge corporation that, as I checked last year, has 6 billion euros in profit.
Why should it borrow money from banks?
Good question.
For example, if you watch any bodybuilding competition or any strength competition and look at the guys who compete there and look at yourself in the mirror, what hits you?
Well, that I look different than them, to put it mildly.
Exactly. It doesn't matter how much you train and how strong you are, you will never have so many muscles in your life.
Because they take all kinds of supplements, steroids, growth hormones, insulin injections, a lot of different things.
And only this allows them to maintain the excessively, physiologically impossible to achieve in the human body, muscle mass.
Because of this, they can carry a lot more weight, their muscles are much more pronounced, because suddenly there are more muscles, so this structure is more visible.
The same is with large corporations, sir.
Normally, no company is able to grow to such size, such inflated, large sizes.
Let's take a look at the story of Anheuser-Busch, because that's exactly what we're talking about.
They bought, for example, Psab Miller for 100 billion dollars.
Where did they get this money from?
If you say that they now have 6 billion, 4 billion, it depends on the year, in profit, then let's take a calculator and see how many years they would have to collect.
That they were the first company in the world that crossed the magical line of profits and the amount of beer sold per million.
It is impossible with the organic, so-called natural development of the company.
It would be unattainable.
What did they do then?
They bought competition.
But how can you buy competition for 100 billion if they earn 1 billion or 2?
When would they afford it?
What did they have to do then?
They had to extra draw these tens and hundreds of billions to be able to buy other companies.
But where will I get 100 billion dollars?
Well, for example, sir, from mega-rich other corporations.
Because no one in the world has such money.
Theoretically, some Jeff Bezos has.
Some Elon Musk has.
There are such people, but they don't have this money.
They are somewhere invested in some magazines, in some companies, trade marks.
Billionaires don't have money, sir.
They just don't.
Likewise, giant corporations don't have money.
Do you think this Anheuser-Busch has that much money?
No, he doesn't.
All these companies are, sir, in debt.
So only in this way can they grow to these unnatural, abnormal sizes.
There is no other method.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to the second break.
Our listeners will also be back in a moment to a topic that is very interesting.
See you later.
The end
The end
What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
With Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"",
we are talking today about the fallacy of a really big business.
Let's go back to the advertisement we started talking about at the beginning of our broadcast.
Isn't it enough that a corporation simply publishes apologies to its consumers,
possibly withdraws the ad, starts producing other kinds of ads?
Well, it just makes this matter more vulgar.
This is impossible.
We already know that these companies need a large, gigantic amount of money.
But I don't know if you know that customers don't affect the president's salary.
So who affects it?
Well, probably those people who put out those 100 billion dollars earlier.
Yes, those who put out this money to them.
Whether it will be in the form of a loan or in the form of locating money there.
Large corporations borrow from even larger financiers.
And there are only two entities in the world that can put out such money.
One entity is the government.
For example, if there were state-owned companies, etc.
It's not a lot in America now, but there used to be a lot of such large corporations that were controlled by the government.
An example of this could be Orlen.
This is one path.
The second path is financial institutions.
Large financial institutions, so-called institutional investors.
For example, it could be banks or large investment funds.
And among others, there is such an entity in Wankreiser, BlackRock.
Black rock, black stone.
Which is known for being one of the largest potentates in the world of finance.
And that he loves the ideology of the ""Woke"", the LGBT, all the other ""progressive"" in quotes.
So very leftist ideologies.
It is these people who decide what this company does and they influence who will be at the head of these large corporations.
But this is only the introduction to the real mystery.
Because to get these big loans, you have to meet very precise requirements.
I'm talking about requirements related to, for example, Environmental Social Government, or ESG.
To get a lot of money, you have to assess the environmental policy, social issues and the approach to managing a given company.
This means that you have to employ the right number of people, also at the highest positions.
From, attention, racial, sexual minorities.
Not only that, you have to give them special extra benefits.
Some free days, super expensive add-ons.
And announce to the world how ""woke"" your business is.
These are the scorings.
And Anheuser-Busch had a 100% perfect score.
It was the most ""woke"" company in the world.
You couldn't be more ""woke"" than Anheuser-Busch.
You have to be aware that large companies can't do anything without external capital.
That external capital controls external companies.
And external companies have clearly specified videos when you can get money, and when you stop getting money.
And here's another mystery.
If for some reason Anheuser-Busch stops fulfilling this perfect 100% ESG,
it can lose funding, which will mean bankruptcy.
All you have to do is for BlackRock to withdraw its shares, and the company is bankrupt overnight.
Today, they lost almost $16 billion in stock prices.
And that didn't make them change their positions at all.
Because for them, only the support of this tiny group of financiers is important.
The rest doesn't matter.
Because if one of them withdraws, their entire international group is bankrupt.
Complete bankruptcy.
Mr. Mariusz, but there are also opposite examples.
Reuters reported that one of the large US retail chains
is withdrawing its collection, which was specifically addressed to the LGBT community,
for the so-called ""Month of Pride"".
Because these products also encounter hostile or even hostile customer reactions.
So maybe someone else is drawing conclusions based on this Budweiser example?
No.
It wasn't about them doing some kind of advertising for gay people, LGBT people.
No, no, no, no.
The game was about the fact that in the ""For Children and the Deaf"" section
there were items, books, clothes, with extremist styles,
which even leftist activists in the USA do not accept.
For example, there were books for the youngest children, entitled ""Bye Bye Binary"".
So ""Goodbye to Binary"".
Books teaching children how to use trans-binary loans.
Or ""bath suits"", in quotation marks, ""friendly to wear"".
So little boys have special compartments where they hide their little nipples
and to be able to put on clothes for a girl.
Such a swimsuit for a girl.
This caused people to get angry and even physically destroy these big stands, advertisements, etc.
And now we come back to Bud Light, because it really wasn't about the fact that
this Bud Light ad caused a backlash from people because there was some transvestite advertising beer.
No!
Bud Light was an icon of this rural America, outside of New York, San Francisco, Chicago, etc.
Such typical leftist stances.
Someone suddenly changed this icon for the face of this transvestite.
They printed the face of this transvestite on the Bud Light can.
But that wasn't even the worst part of it all.
This famous, infamous homosexual, transvestite, let's call him what we want,
announced the finale of his anniversary of becoming a year-old girl.
And people were like ""Wait, this adult homosexual is a year-old girl?""
In order to celebrate this, Anheuser-Busch printed a can with his face on it.
And people said ""No, that's too far.""
If he touches children, the patience of Americans is over.
I think it would end for everyone.
Same with Target, same with Bud Light.
These ideologies, they reach for children, sir.
They reach for children very brutally.
In their slogans, in their material, in their books, in their clothes, in their ads.
They openly, openly reached for children.
We'll be back after the break, continuing this topic of conversation.

Hello, Mariusz. Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
And this wisdom is needed to understand the topic we're talking about today.
You just said that average Americans stood up for children.
In that case, in the United States, aren't there any regulations that protect children enough from, for example, advertising, alcohol, or even manipulation?
Why doesn't the law deal with this problem?
Good question.
There's only one answer.
The law is there to protect the interests of the ruling class.
In other words, the law is for the small, not the big ones.
The law obliges the small ones, yes? It obliges the small ones.
Of course, only and exclusively.
The big ones, billionaires, the largest corporations in the world, are above the law because they create the law.
If we were to look at the legislation system in the United States, it would be much more complicated than it would seem from our European point of view.
Our legal system is definitely different, just completely different.
In the USA, the whole legal system is very much dependent on influence, in other words, money.
Okay, but that leads to the violations in which children really become victims, right?
Yes, and even victims of the literally physical meaning of the word.
Because all these agendas and campaigns that are now being boycotted, and companies like Anheuser-Busch or Target, these types of corporations,
they physically give money to clinics that abuse minors, literally children, under the pretext of ""corrective repair"", as they call it, of the gender.
So a little boy is physically abused to make a little girl out of him.
And this is really happening. And such clinics are, and they are financed precisely by these entities.
Mr. Merus, if the law does not work, then a consumer revolt, a common consumer revolt, can be an effective tool and can lead to such ads referring to the gender ideology or LGBT movements no longer be?
No, it's just impossible. The answer is brutally simple and based on 100% on the economy.
As we talked about before, and I hope I showed it quite clearly, that already now the largest corporations are being torn away from their dependence on consumers and small investors.
It doesn't really matter, because the biggest money and the biggest dependence are on gigantic, multinational funds managing literally gigantic amounts, unimaginable for normal people, and only they depend on them.
So even if all customers stop buying, these companies have no way out, in short.
And not only that, from what I checked, 75% of companies in the US, let's talk about the largest companies on the stock exchange, the bonuses for the authorities are paid based on indicators in the ESG, not financial results.
In short, it depends on whether they are well assessed by the racial, sexual, environmental scoring, by these extremely leftist environments, and they have money from it, and not from whether their company makes or loses money.
This is a parody, but these are the facts.
Mr. Marysiu, then who are these international corporations and funds that bought such a large company as Anheuser-Busch or Budweiser? Who are they that they don't have to worry about social reception? Where did such market giants come from?
Here we are talking about the so-called ""Great Three"", i.e. three entities that control almost 90% of the items listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
This is simply unimaginable control. It all went on for decades, of course, but people didn't understand, they weren't interested in the economy, who cares, who buys what shares, who is in what government, people wanted to live, pay their taxes, buy things, raise children, and that's all they cared about.
And unfortunately, through such thinking, a situation arose when three entities control almost the entire economy and control almost all the largest companies that we think are giants, such as Disney, Anheuser-Busch, oh, what a big company.
This company is in the pocket of real giants, this ""Great Three"" as it is called.
In fact, it is these entities and people who stand behind them that control everything and issue orders.
We have to finish, unfortunately our time is limited, but we promise our listeners that we will come back to this topic.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist. Thank you very much for the interview. The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
The economist-financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak, is our guest.
I wanted to persuade you today to talk about war.
But how about the economist about war as an economic phenomenon?
Let's talk about how much does war cost.
There is now a war on Ukraine beyond our borders,
and last year the Ukrainian prime minister revealed that one day of war costs his country 70 million dollars.
How do we add the foreign aid that Ukraine received?
In 10 months, it was reported that it was 150 billion dollars.
On average, it gives an additional 300 million dollars.
But it still looks pale when calculating the numbers of scientists at the Russian Academy of Sciences,
as our media reported, they calculated that Russia costs a billion dollars on the day of the war.
Who can afford such huge expenses?
No one and literally everyone.
Because it's a pretty interesting phenomenon,
that actually war, from an economic point of view, should be a complete tragedy.
But it is not.
To quote a certain quote,
""During the war, the greatest economic development takes place,
and if we eliminated the boring period of peace, we would actually have development all the time.""
War has a very profound impact on the lives of all societies.
It eliminates a lot of people who really cost,
that's what dies in the war most often.
Well, weak people, the elderly.
So what costs the most is the budget maintenance.
In addition, productivity increases, social divisions decrease,
there are no increases, no one even thinks about it.
So you can keep the whole society very cheaply,
eliminating most of the costs that you normally bear.
The efficiency of work increases,
industrial production increases, which is usually the carrier of development of each country.
So success.
Of course, as you rightly noticed at the beginning,
it all costs an incredible amount of money.
Well, where do countries that are waging war get their money from?
Ukraine has economic problems.
Because you have to pay for ammunition, for armament, for equipment,
you have to pay for the soldiers, you have to pay for the damage to those who died,
you have to pay for the costs of treating the wounded.
These are huge expenses.
Where does Ukraine get its money from, for example?
Yes, you are right.
Looking at this conflict, we see two completely opposite philosophies of financing war.
Think Tank, a country that deals with energy analysis,
has shown that from the sale of energy carriers,
since the day of the full-scale attack,
almost 100 billion euros have been influenced by Russia,
of which almost 60% from the EU,
only during the first 100 days of the war.
So, as you said, they have a billion euros a day.
And we pay them for it.
That Russia, on the other hand, makes more money than before the war.
Financial Times recently reported
that Moscow could add about 100 billion dollars to its foreign assets of free obstacles.
Russia can also support other activities,
for example, tons of gold or contracts in the style of the construction of a nuclear power plant in Egypt.
Here are some funny facts that the Sudanese air force
searched for a plane to transport cookies to Russia.
They found a box with a ton of gold there.
And this was only one of a dozen flights that we know of.
Let's add that for years, through the invasion,
Putin bought hundreds of tons of gold,
which, with a price jump, gave him a huge profit.
Officially, they have about 2,300 tons of gold,
worth about 150 billion dollars.
This will be useful, because the declared expenses for national defense in 2023
are planned to be calculated at $ 84 billion.
Which gives about 40% more than they assumed.
Well, what does it look like in the case of Ukraine?
Ukraine does not have such resources.
I will probably surprise listeners by saying who helps the plutonians in making money.
I quote here a well-informed US intelligence official,
Seymour Hersh.
It was Zelensky who bought diesel oil from the Russians with a discount.
And who paid for gasoline and oil?
We. Putin and his oligarchs make millions on it.
It is estimated that the president of Ukraine and his entourage
have spent at least $ 400 million on the purchase of fuel.
Ukraine is currently in the 120th place in the world ranking of corruption in 180 countries.
So it is shockingly worse than all its neighbors, except Russia.
The issue of corruption was raised during a January visit to Kiev by the CIA chief, William Burns,
who delivered to Zelensky the list of 35 corrupt officials and officers.
Zelensky was forced to react to Washington's press.
He publicly fired only 10 people.
He limited himself to officials who brazenly bragged about their money
driving a new Mercedes around Kiev.
This is not the first such corruption sensation of the media hero of Ukraine.
I will remind you of the Pandora Papers.
What is Ukraine doing now officially?
It is getting longer.
We already know about the military aid that has long exceeded $ 100 billion.
And yet they lose fights and are unable to start the promised offensive.
They make various excuses.
They said it was too hot for the offensive.
Earlier they said it was too cold.
Isabel Coleman from the American International Development Agency says
that Ukraine is waiting for the world's largest reconstruction project.
Ukrainians estimate the costs to be $ 750 billion to $ 1 billion.
And that's a lot of money someone will get.
That's why Zelensky meets Lawrence Fink,
called the king of Wall Street, the boss of Black Rock.
The same one from the Bud Light scandal from the previous audition,
which is being pressured on the biggest LGBT, Wokeness and similar abnormal things.
Mr. Mariusz, let's pause for a moment.
And now...
The end
The end
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
The economist, financier Mariusz Stefaniak is our guest.
We are talking about the financial and economic side of the war.
We all read ""The Doll"" and remember the character of Vokulski,
who made money in the war.
In Russia, by the way.
Who is making money in this war in Ukraine?
Who is making money?
Of course, those who have money.
These are the rights of this world, the rights of the economy.
It's easier to be rich than to stop being poor.
In Ukraine, the oligarchs make money,
the mafia makes money, related to the officials, of course.
And above all, the most powerful and greedy financial entities make money.
Like the Big Three, we mentioned Black Rock before.
Our authorities also assume that if you want peace, get ready for war.
It's an old saying.
Our arms expenses, Polish arms expenses, are growing very much.
They grew last year, this year they will grow more.
Anyway, we are not the only country in the world,
generally, after years of reducing arms expenses,
last year, for the first time, global arms expenses increased.
Arms companies are going through a very good period.
Maybe it's enough to just invest, buy shares,
because such companies are also listed on the stock exchanges,
and participate in this income section from the war.
Some brokers, anyway, are persuading to do this.
I don't think it works like that.
You know what? It's probably a bit more complicated.
The whole system of arms companies, politics and economy, has two levels.
The visible and visible level, and the invisible and invisible level,
which comes out through various scams, some actions of investigative journalists,
through parliamentary committees, or in the US Congress.
There are beautiful committees that show amazing things about this subject.
This is a bit more complicated.
And generally, it's not that the biggest growth is in the arms sector,
because the biggest growth, which was also shown to us,
of course, our previous auditions, were, for example, in the energy sector,
in the fuel sector, in the sector of materials or raw materials,
so-called ""peas"", or even gold, which we also mentioned.
This was the most you could do, you could earn the most.
And of course, what is, in my opinion, an undervalued source of income?
Food.
I wouldn't bet, sir, on profits on arms companies,
only on food percentages.
What is the most valuable in a war?
Food, sir.
There is also an old proverb that says that the one who benefits is guilty.
Russia is to blame for this war, but what is its benefit from this aggression against Ukraine?
Is it just about taking over the territory and, as Russia says,
protecting the minority of the Russian population in Ukraine?
I don't know if Russia is to blame, because I'm not a judge here, but I'm an economist.
And I know some facts from recent years, and more and more data that I have access to,
which are public, says that the US is worth more than Russia.
Special services, the US, among others, and these big megacorporations.
But they didn't attack Ukraine in February last year, starting a full-scale war.
Of course they did.
But you know what? Is the hammer to blame for your broken head, or the hand that broke the hammer?
So please explain what is the mechanism of action between this hand and the hammer.
Fact number one is that there was a deal between NATO and Russia,
which clearly stated that NATO would not send its influence to Russia in any way.
That they would stop in Poland and not move even a centimeter more.
And it worked for a nice few years.
Only then something happened, the so-called ""orange revolution"",
where the legally elected Ukrainian government was overthrown, I remind you,
and replaced by a very strange structure, which, among other things, led to the current situation.
Please check what happened next, and how Russia reacted to this situation.
God forbid I don't explain Putin here, or put him in a defensive position, because he's a bandit, a thief,
and that's clear for anyone with a minimum of knowledge, which doesn't mean that he can't be right in anything.
I remember the Katyn case, which was known to Poles for years.
I was also taught that it was Hitler, the evil, vile Hitler, who murdered these poor Polish officers.
It just turned out that Katyn is a big massacre, and Hitler didn't necessarily answer for it.
Here we can also have a few ugly secrets that will come to light.
So this evil is not always the cause of all the atrocities.
Putin is also a disgusting personality, and we know that, which doesn't mean that all the bad things in the world are his fault.
Mr. Mariusz, we'll come back to this topic in the third episode.
I invite you to take a break.
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
Greetings, Mr. Mariusz. Economist, financier Mariusz Stefaniak.
Today we're talking about the war and its economic aspects.
We've been talking about the fact that Ukraine, until the 10th month of the war, received financial aid for armaments and aid to the state budget exceeding 150 billion dollars.
What is the interest of the United States and what is the benefit of the United States, which invests the most money in Ukraine?
The question is reasonable, but in such a way it leads us a little into a mistake.
Let's distinguish two things. The nation, the government, and let's distinguish private, rich corporations.
And then we'll be able to discuss the economy.
The United States, as a nation, does not gain anything, but loses.
And it loses huge money, huge opportunities for its own development.
Because it is clear that if we send this money abroad, it is not in our budget.
Sending gigantic money to some super long war, in which they have no interest as a nation, is a very bad economic decision.
The government is very much in favor of this, it is able to rebuild and build up its notations, being, as it is often referred to, a policeman of the world.
The United States is already known for attacking the state in any place in the world and does not suffer any consequences.
A lot, a lot, a lot of such modern examples.
For our life we had the opportunity to observe all this.
And now we have another example where the United States is very brutally interfering in the history of the world and in the history of individual nations with their interests.
And here we come to the third part of this layout, i.e. a gigantic fuel-armament complex and financial behind it, because these are related things, sir.
They who direct funds from the budget, from the pockets of US citizens to a very small number of several hundred entities, which for absurdly high prices, provide services based on the production of equipment,
sending fuel, for example, construction companies, which then have to, in a nutshell, carry out reconstruction, and in fact, they draw gigantic amounts, because no one checks whether these amounts are real or not.
No one verifies it, this is the funniest thing in all of this.
Whatever price they give, the governments pay, because they really do not pay, because they take it out of their pocket, so the amount does not matter to them.
Mr. Marysia, but in the common narrative, help for Ukraine is dictated by humanitarian reasons, in terms of social justice.
We help the attacked, just as we help the attacked in a dark alley and try to chase the attacker,
but here we make an effort to chase the attacker.
It sounds beautiful, but it's probably not like that.
Let me remind you of simple facts. Palestinians have been murdered for decades.
Where are these countries that help murdered children, women?
I have not heard of a great international action of helping the attacked.
The same goes for African countries, where there are completely crushing slaughters.
There is no help, why? Because, for example, there Shell has its own place of extraction of oil.
And it supports those murderers who murder the population, supports military juntaes who terrorize the whole country.
It pays off for them.
And then, the rule of law and democracy do not matter much.
Why did Ukraine interest them so much to defend this attacked country so much?
Why do they help so selectively?
Because of the famous moral of Kale Got.
If Kale steals a cow, it's a good deed.
If Kale steals a cow, it's a bad deed.
And for me, Kale is an international financier, and USA in particular.
They tell us what is good, what is bad, who to defend and who not to defend.
Morality has nothing to do with it, sir, only money.
Brutal business and politics.
I would like to ask you one more thing.
I know that there are old powers in the world, for example the United States.
There are also countries that aspire to their importance to grow.
We have talked about China many times, but there are also India, huge Brazil, RPA.
Is a new division of the world beginning to emerge in Ukraine?
Is this division of the world reflected there?
You got it right, because the war in Ukraine is not really about Ukraine.
It is a war of two economic systems and, by the way, the world view, but mainly economic.
This is a fight for the domination of the dollar in the world.
The point is that what you mentioned, i.e. these new economic powers,
if you collect the countries that you mentioned very correctly,
the greatest economic force in the world is created, which has one simple goal.
To reduce or even eliminate the dollar as a world currency.
This is what we are talking about in the case of the conflict in Ukraine.
That this is the war of two economic systems, when the world of finance, let's say in the American word,
although it is not quite so, but mostly they have a decisive voice here,
is fighting this eastern conglomerate of powers, in the style of China, India or Russia,
for domination of the world economy.
Mrs. Marysia, thank you very much for the conversation.
We will probably come back more than once.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial officer, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we are talking about our leading national concern, about Orlen.
Economic services have recently received information that Orlen, our biggest national concern, will take over the Puławy nitrogen group by the end of the year.
It is also the largest producer of agricultural fertilizers in Poland.
Interestingly, this is happening in a situation where the company with very high income has suddenly lost, and this is serious, last year it lost PLN 400 million.
Let's start with an explanation of where this loss came from.
The official explanation is that it is a double effect, a mixture on the gas market, which is necessary in this production. Is this a sufficient reason?
Indeed, this is a valid question.
And maybe I will add that they had previously gained PLN 882 million.
Jumping from such gains to such crushing losses, well, it is something to look at.
Officially, this is caused by high gas prices, without a doubt by the mass flood of Poland by fertilizers and fertilizers from outside the EU,
but for me it is just another media fable and few people understand what is really behind it and what the consequences will be.
Putting everything on Putin has no economic justification.
This is the reason, first of all, EU policy and such an eco-mania that currently rules these bought-up euro-idiots.
Mr. Mariusz, I will give you a word. The EU desperately wants our farm to be ecological, healthy, to use as little artificial fertilizers as possible,
which should reduce the demand for fertilizers, and reducing the demand should reduce the price of fertilizers. Is this the mechanism you are talking about?
You have made a good logical conclusion, but it has nothing to do with reality.
I will explain this, maybe.
To understand this, you should look at the entire geopolitical and economic structure of the world.
Fact number one.
Currently, in Asia and Africa, starvation is beginning.
And I'm not talking about the current poverty or starvation that has been there for decades.
No, I'm talking about a completely new phenomenon. I'm talking about a massive disruption of food production on a global scale.
One of the reasons is nitrogen fertilizers.
Exactly what our fertilizer and fertilizer nitrates produce.
Market disruptions on fertilizers is an introduction to starvation.
I will remind you, if someone does not know, that Poland accounts for 2% of the world export of these fertilizers, and Russia and China for about 25%.
But what, there is no such thing in the world?
Yes and no.
I will only remind you what we said, I showed the whole mechanism once to the listener, for example, of coal and fuel.
Rapid leaps of several hundred percent, shocking shortages, gigantic speculations, and then destructive long-term effects for the entire economy.
And all this for what reason?
Only political decisions, ideological and not economic reasons.
We have exactly the same in the world of fertilizers, in the world of food production.
Only there were consequences that all companies will become poorer because their costs will jump rapidly.
But here we are talking about a gigantic amount of people's physical starvation.
The facts are that in Poland and in the world, fertilizers are extremely expensive.
And this crazy, among others, EU policy wants to change it to eco.
Only there is no economic justification.
But in this case, why does Orlen buy a company that has financial problems and whose development opportunities are perhaps under a lot of question?
It would actually seem that Orlen buys it from an economic point of view.
And they explain it this way, that the extension of their distribution chains is the production of various chemical substances.
Orlen does not necessarily have to buy it for logically, economically justified reasons.
This answer undermines two assumptions in this whole system.
Three years ago, Orlen bought local regional press publications.
And it was not under the influence of profit, but under the slogan of repolonization of the media.
Perhaps in the case of nitrogen, it is also about maintaining the Polish character of this or other companies that Orlen has taken over.
Maybe, I don't know what's in the minds of politicians, I can only analyze economic facts.
I know for sure that consolidations give gigantic, monopolistic profits.
And they are needed by politicians to buy voters for money from their own pockets.
This is funny.
Another example is the Chora Initiative with a rise of 500 or 800+.
What is funny, when I read the data, most Poles are against it.
I am glad that people are becoming more and more economically conscious.
And I hope that our auditions, to some symbolic, albeit to a degree, also help in this.
In this case, I propose that we move on to the next part of our hearing for other reasons.
A short break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economic and financial expert, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about our leading national concern, Orlen.
Until recently, the main industry of Orlen, and actually historically speaking, was car fuel.
It is the former CPN, known to all Poles.
And fuel, also in connection with the decisions of the European Union, should go down in history within a dozen or so years.
Maybe the concern has no other choice but to look for a new market, a new place on the market.
I recommend reading the data from the 1970s about the future of fuel.
You know this technique. Be polite, because the witch will come and take you.
But I think we should grow up from this age when we catch such tricks.
The same is true of global warming.
What models predicted many years ago what would happen and nothing is confirmed.
Nothing works.
Just like the infamous masks, lockdowns, forced vaccinations that were supposed to save lives.
Now every expert will say that these were the stupidest and most harmful ideas.
However, on all the things I have mentioned, someone made huge money, and none of it was counted.
Someone predicts that this and that will happen, and nothing works.
We can start to wonder if we really want to listen to such people who predict this.
Because I am not saying that there is no connection between environmental destruction and fuel.
Of course there is.
But the question is what is the connection?
How much has it advanced?
And are there other factors that may affect climate or environmental changes in 90%?
Because it is exactly like that in this case, and it is scientific, you just need to do any analysis and scientific studies.
In fact, all these fuel, coal, all these things, we are discovering new and new layers of it.
The mega-dumpings are being discovered.
Okay, but if someone updates these predictions, well, no, because it is better to scare people and make money on it.
What is the effect of this whole boom on the eco, when it comes to motorization, for example?
Let's say, look at your car. You will see a lot of extremely expensive parts, catalysts, various strangest things, Lambda probes, etc.
Which someone produced, someone made a giga-dumping on it.
Well, it is some kind of absurd.
We don't see that this is stupid.
That is why I suspect that if we speak from a rational, scientific, economic point of view,
then fuel and cars should be fine, but if some brilliant legislator introduces, for example, a ban on the sale of cars with fuel engines,
which you know, there are exactly such bills, then at this point it is clear that fuel stations will be unnecessary.
Mr. Mariusz, let's get back to this topic of other reasons, apart from economic reasons, serious decisions of Orlen's authorities.
I wonder if Orlen is such a legendary king of MIDAS, who will turn anything he touches into gold.
Because another example of such a recent takeover by Orlen is the company Ruch, also a state-owned company.
Once the only distributor of press and small things on the market.
With the takeover of Ruch, the launch of their own courier delivery network was to be launched.
Well, this network works, but it doesn't make a great return career. Was it a good move?
The move probably made some sense, but I would not expect any success at all and I would not look at the horizon,
because from what I know about the world of economics, no state-owned company, read - politically managed company,
will not have any success where there is any competition.
And in this sector that you are talking about, there is strong competition.
This is not only for Poland, but for the whole world, to be clear.
I will repeat to you my favorite economic maxim.
What is good for the economy is bad for politicians.
And what is bad for politicians is good for the economy, ladies and gentlemen.
And this is the beginning of another series of questions that I want to ask you in the last third part of our audition.
For now, a short break.
The end of the first part.
The end of the second part.
What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial advisor, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation, our guest today.
Today we are talking about Orlen.
I would like you to tell us a little more frankly, to shed a little more international light on how state-owned companies or state giants work.
Because we are not any exception here.
Such companies have been operating even in capitalist countries forever.
For 20 or 30 years, state-owned companies and state-owned enterprises were liquidated under the slogan that the private owner will manage better.
And in many cases it ended with the fact that these companies, which have been privatized, no longer exist.
Or they were included in some larger structures.
Well, it didn't burn out completely.
So how is it, Mr. Mariusz? Private or state?
Or maybe some intermediate model?
Great question.
Indeed, you are right, Polish privatization is an economic complete disaster.
The only question is why it was so.
What we call in books on history, on economics, privatization, was simply a robbery, a distribution.
It was the so-called ""wild privatization"".
Giants were sold for a fraction of the value of car factories, such items.
Of course, it did not go to super-smart entrepreneurs, to make it clear.
Because privatization, by nature, and in general, the principle of economics says that the resources should be owned by the one who manages them best.
However, here, in this so-called privatization, it was not like that at all.
There were no real messages, except for friends in certain circles, in the catchers, in the trade fairs.
And besides, companies were sold that had gigantic potential.
Not only that, companies that had great financial condition were sold.
Everyone would like such a business, but not everyone, unfortunately, can.
Because not everyone has friends among the ruling politicians, etc.
The second part of the answer is this.
Poland has one of the most complicated VAT laws and tax laws in all of Europe.
And now you can't imagine that if you are a state-owned company, no one will take care of this company,
won't destroy it, won't impose any absurd penalty, because it is your company, you are the government, you are the official.
So you are absolutely unpunished.
But if you take it as a private entrepreneur, everything changes.
You are destroyed, controlled, penalties are imposed.
These are the reasons why state business is better, but of course it is hopelessly managed.
And from what I know as an economist, state companies have successes only where there is no competition.
Let's go back to Orlen.
One of the most popular and controversial transactions of Orlen in the last period was the connection with LOTOS.
In exchange for the agreement, we had to give some of the petrol stations of LOTOS to Hungary
and sell 30% of the refinery shares of the Gdańsk Saudi Aramco.
Was it worth connecting these two giants?
It is definitely worth connecting.
The bigger something is, the better it is defended on the markets, it has a greater impact.
It all makes sense, right? Connection, consolidation make sense.
I just don't hide that my personal doubts are aroused by the entire transaction of selling refinery to the Arabs of Gdańsk.
The amount we got for it is a joke.
I remember that there was a joke that Lewandowski gets more money than the Arabs paid for 30% of Gdańsk's refinery.
And we were forced to do it, as you rightly noticed.
The effect is that they have 30% of a super profitable business, and we have one of the highest fuel prices at the stations.
Maybe thanks to friendship with the Arabs we have a guarantee of Saudi oil supply and peace on the market.
In a situation when we cut off from the supply from Russia, this is an important argument.
This is a hopeless argument.
We have one of the most expensive fuel prices.
Why do I need a friend who sells me much more expensive than an enemy who sold me much cheaper?
We have normal diplomatic relations with Russia.
We have economic relations with Russia.
Why should we not do something that is good for Poles, for the Polish economy, for the Polish interest of the state?
As far as I understand it, we have here commissioned someone who made money on it.
Who cares about Saudi Arabia's friendship now?
Certainly not the Poles, because the Poles have no interest in it.
We physically pay for every refinery, sir.
Mr. Mariusz, but entering the Saudi Aramco system, we entered the World First League.
We play it on our own.
You asked a question whether on our own.
Perhaps not in line with the interests of the Poles, but maybe there are such interests of Orlen,
who is starting some research and development projects with Saudi Aramco.
Maybe it was about the interest of the corporation.
If it was a corporation, I would say that this is the interest of the corporation.
But this is a truck managed politically, sir.
So all this is also the result of political decisions and for political gains.
Not economic, not economic.
From what I see the whole fuel system in the world, here we are the perpetrators of the will of the USA.
And its interests in the Far East.
The USA has been worried about it for decades and wars in that area.
And individual entities and mega-rich people behind them are getting rich on it.
Because of course, American citizens are also losing on it, to make it clear.
Just like the Poles are losing on it.
Mr. Mariusz, but I follow not only Polish information portals.
And for the first time I hear that the world is in danger of starvation.
Are you exaggerating with such black visions?
Look closely at Asia.
Indonesia, Turkmenistan, India.
Dozens of places in the world that openly speak about food shortages.
But this food was enough not long ago.
Not only that, there was a global food overproduction.
Gigantic food overproduction.
Thousands of tons of food thrown into the trash with the ban on their use.
Now, suddenly, how did it happen that we went from a super food overproduction to food shortages?
Among other things, one of these mysterious reasons is fertilizers.
And thanks to that we live so comfortably.
But I think someone started to mind it.
The food crisis is also taking its beginning in this Ukrainian conflict.
Do you remember our auditions about fuel, coal, fertilizers?
These are all things that, by a strange coincidence, converge at certain points.
At the confluence of this Ukrainian war, there is a war of two worlds.
And the starvation that is already spreading around the world,
results, among other things, from this conflict.
The increase in the price of fertilizers was before this conflict.
And the fact that the fertilizers jumped four or five times up, this is not normal.
There was no real, rational, but political reason for this.
That it was politically decided that fertilizers are bad, that the eco-future of humanity depends on it.
Only now, people are physically dying from this hunger.
Countries that were great exporters of food suddenly stop.
And we try to ignore the fact that what is happening now with fertilizers
depends on the amount of food we can give our children.
And at this point we will put a stop.
Thank you very much for the interview.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist, today
is talking about green energy,
photovoltaics.
Mr. Mariusz, I didn't hear, but I saw.
Actually, I see every day
that on every second house in my area
photovoltaic panels have been installed in recent years.
On sunny days, they produce so much energy
that they need to be turned off.
Because the network does not accept such an amount of energy.
It happens especially on Sundays,
when most production plants,
which usually use a lot of energy,
are closed and do not work.
At the same time, in our area,
every now and then another company
is making a proposal and wants to build
large photovoltaic farms.
In a moment it will turn out that we have
overproduction of green energy,
overproduction of green energy.
Can all this be somehow balanced,
calculated and built
so that there is just enough of these facilities?
In fact, it could be,
but of course
it is impossible.
It is worth considering
how it is all arranged.
First of all, people think that
connecting something to the network
solves any topic.
No, it doesn't solve anything,
because this is just the beginning
of the whole scheme.
This is a topic not only for Poland.
It concerns all countries
that have more than one source
of energy producers and receivers.
Technically, I know
that it could be calculated perfectly,
but I know that in our system,
in our system of managing networks,
it is totally impossible.
There are only two reasons.
One, this is incompetence
and obvious carelessness
in the management of the network.
All subsequent governments
for the security of energy
in Poland are connected
with the EU's imposed limits,
in no way inconsistent
with what is currently
working in Poland.
But, Mr. Mariusz,
it seems that the state can
control this process,
because it distributes subsidies
and it is quite good
for people who install
small photovoltaic installations.
Would it be profitable
to install and produce
green energy from the sun?
People would do it?
The very idea of ​​subsidies
is some kind of economic idiocy for me.
Please think.
If we have to pay more
for citizens to buy something
useful for them,
it is stupidity of the government
and citizens.
If it is not good for the citizens,
it is evidently a harm to the citizens
because the government has the opportunity
and even the duty to know
what is profitable and what is not.
So where is the place for subsidies?
The whole mechanism
is that influential
and greedy mega-rich
have an influence on
greedy and influential politicians.
What for?
To sell illogically
expensive, and sometimes
unprofitable technologies
on a literally massive scale.
Some cool ideology
is added to it,
a few regulations
and success is ready.
A politician boasts how he cares
about the destroyed land,
past generations,
how he pays to help
these poor citizens
to live better and more modern.
A businessman, of course,
counts colossal profits
that he has never achieved
by acting honestly
to help the citizens.
Because all the subsidies and all the objects
and offices are living comfortably
from the money taken
from his own pocket.
And they are spoiling the lives of his children
because most of these actions
will be paid by
the next generations.
Just like these unfortunate
and in all aspects harmful
wind farms that you mentioned.
They have literally no advantages,
from any point of view,
and only disadvantages.
Except, of course, the mega profit
for people who sell them.
Let's add that I'm talking about Poland.
Because there are places in the world where it makes sense,
but they are still expensive
and artificially
high wages,
so their efficiency
is low.
Literally like the whole shop with these electric cars.
The rule of the economy is not to be cheated.
So instead of being better,
it's worse.
I think you can see it with the naked eye,
even being a complete financial illiterate.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you for a break.
We will continue the topic in a moment.

What is the role of Mr. Mariusz?
Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, economic and financial economist,
today he is talking about
green energy, photovoltaics.
You said that
European policy imposes
certain standards on us. Whatever you say,
we have managed to limit ourselves significantly
thanks to green energy,
the production of energy from sources
that pollute the environment.
It turned out that the model that was
invented is quite effective.
Private capital,
endowed by state capital,
caused an avalanche of photovoltaics growth in Poland,
which we have already mentioned.
Suddenly, we began to meet all the EU requirements
regarding the reduction
of the green energy produced.
The strangest thing is that our authorities
are surprised by the scale of this phenomenon.
Yes, they are always surprised
by what they themselves cause.
Indeed, what you said
is confirmed on paper,
that we have reached 15%.
Let's add,
for listeners, that the assumption
is 10% for Malta,
49% for Sweden.
Of course, you are right again
that the Eurostat noted
that photovoltaics was developing
the fastest in the EU
from all renewable energy sources,
starting in 2008,
when these regulations were introduced,
we are talking about the climate package 2020,
from a symbolic 1%.
Unfortunately, all this is
costly for Poles,
pseudo-success.
It makes no logical
or economic sense
to connect
tens of thousands of new photovoltaics
without a complex reconstruction
of the entire transmission network
and managing this transmission.
Of course,
no one has even planned
since 2008,
not to mention any symbolic investments.
And today, the authorities have awakened.
As you rightly noticed,
shocked by what they themselves
have done,
they have caused by subsidies and regulations.
From the latest data, I see
that the development plan
of the transmission system
2023-2032
has been published.
Where the spending
of over 32 billion
is planned
on the transmission network,
the North-South connection,
the ownership of renewable energy
and energy stores.
Five years too late?
They willingly signed
under the climate package
and then with subsidies,
they launched on posters.
We pay for it.
And for the next decades we will pay,
because let's face it,
we don't have those tens of billions.
We will have to borrow them again,
borrow.
And who will pay for it?
The Lord, the Lord's children
and maybe the children of their children.
This is a specialty of our political parties.
However, you say that
the whole phenomenon is set up
so that the great producers,
I guess, of photovoltaic panels,
make excellent interests.
But I see it in my environment.
Many medium-sized entrepreneurs
are looking for a field
for photovoltaic farms,
are looking for the possibility of joining.
This is probably just a profitable interest for them.
And yes and no.
I would like you to ask me
if the Chinese eco-twists
are being sold by the media,
because all these technological eco-miracles
are coming to us from there.
Because it's a much bigger scheme
than you might think.
Okay, but let's go back to our average businessman.
Does it pay them or do they only have such illusions?
And yes and no.
So does it pay them today
and at the time of investment,
at the time of signing documents,
at the time of equipment installation?
Definitely yes.
You have to think about it and observe
at least for the last few years,
when the market is changing dynamically.
What changes have occurred?
Well, you answer this question yourself.
Which way is it going, sir?
Will it pay you more and more
or less and less?
Well, it's a business that depends a lot
on how the rules are set,
and the rules do not always favor small producers.
It can be said clearly,
without a shadow of a doubt,
that it is definitely harder,
and less profitable.
I refer to all our previous auditions.
Do you see the same scheme
where something is launched,
the motor is very fast,
then suddenly there is some shock,
rapid price jumps,
as it was with gas.
Everyone was investing in gas heating.
It's so cool, cheap, comfortable, a revelation, a miracle.
And then the gas bills came,
suddenly it turned out that the gas prices
jumped several times.
Why don't people learn from the examples?
Why don't they touch the same mechanism?
Well, I dream of such a situation
that I will be a power producer myself
and I will use it myself.
During the day I will probably be self-sufficient.
At night I will turn on some buttons,
I will switch to the network delivery,
but then I will be separately calculated.
I will become such an energy island,
self-sufficient.
Is it at all possible to
in such a way, very freely,
draw energy from the network?
No, it is certainly not possible in Poland.
You can't be such a green energy island
that you are independent.
It is impossible.
Not in Poland.
There are countries where it is possible,
of course, paradoxically,
even despite large investments,
the bills may increase,
not fall.
And it affects many elements that you will meet.
Either if you reach the best specialists in the industry,
or when it's too late,
because you can already catch this eco-trap yourself.
I invite you to the next break
and we'll be back in a moment.
See you later.

What is the role of Mrs. Mariusz?
I am Stefan, as an economist,
a financier, today I am touching on the topics
of green photovoltaic energy.
We are at the stage of changing the regulations
under the EU's dictation,
which requires it from us.
It is, among other things,
about such things as dynamic energy prices,
the possibility of changing
the energy supplier
by the client in a flash,
for example, within 24 hours.
It's all under the slogan
that people and clients
should be better, in theory,
cheaper. How do you assess this?
Will it be cheaper?
No, it won't be, of course, it can't be.
And all the things you mentioned
are introduced and some of them already work,
such as, for example, the dynamic energy prices.
And it is, let's say,
openly, crushingly, unprofitable for people.
Those who were lucky to be included
in the previous regulations
will probably pray thanksgivingly,
looking at how it works in the new cover.
Because in such a system,
you will have to pay for the fact
that you produce the best,
so-called clean energy
and you will pay absurdly high prices
for this dirty coal energy.
In the current regulations,
you can be remotely turned on
and off your devices
when you have the greatest
overproduction.
Not only that,
you also pay
the energy supplier,
the energy plant,
to the green energy network.
And this is completely absurd to me.
I personally saw the accounts of producers
who sold their electricity,
this super green electricity,
for literally a penny,
and bought it for 4 zlotys
per kilowatt.
Well, Mr. Mariusz,
but maybe technological development
in the future, for example,
introducing 5G networks, the Internet of Things,
will enable such a wonderful
tuning of recipients and suppliers.
For example, our refrigerators
will receive a signal on the Internet
when they should freeze more
and when they should freeze less,
because there is more or less electricity
in the network.
Our cars will automatically
be something like a storage of energy
that will be collected when there is an excess
and will be returned when there is no electricity.
A few million cars have great possibilities.
Will the future bring such a solution?
I don't know what the future will bring,
because I'm not a fairy,
but you know about 5G, the Internet of Things,
and so on.
Everything that is shown in the media,
on flyers, it doesn't work.
By definition, 5G networks
are short-range networks,
i.e. you would have to put
amplifiers, transmitters,
receivers on every street.
This is unattainable at the moment.
For example, China, which, as one of the first
in the world, introduced these networks,
and we take these technologies in Europe
from Chinese companies.
It doesn't work at all.
This is one big, gigantic failure.
They are not able to
even in no plans
to cover their cities with a network.
Well, maybe in that case,
when we manage to build some energy storage,
then the problem will also be solved.
For example, our government wants to build
high-speed power plants
to collect energy when it is cheap
and pump these tanks up,
and then, when there is the greatest need,
to start the production of such a power plant.
Could this be a solution
on a national scale?
Yes, it's a great idea, but I have two questions.
Why is it a few decades too late?
And are we definitely not
better than the technology
from the 19th century?
In my opinion,
the purpose of avoiding
this famous elephant in the room,
i.e. geothermics,
is being avoided.
Geothermics solves
all problems with the production,
gasification of energy.
And by the way, really,
as one of the few,
it solves the problems of ecology.
An example is Iceland.
According to Eustat,
the result of electricity consumption
from the ozone is roughly
99.6%.
First of all, thanks
to geothermal storage.
Poland
has one of the best
geothermal storage
in the world.
I saw maps, by the way, of one of the projects.
Great geothermal conglomerates
were to be created,
which would combine three aspects.
The health part
of geothermal resources,
the thermal part and the energy part
of geothermal storage.
Do you know how it ended?
It was blocked
by the officials of the ministry.
People from the ministry were there
and there was a big argument.
Why are you blocking something
that we have documents, data, calculations?
It's the most brilliant.
All these stupid harmful fans
and so on. What is it at all?
It's a joke.
We have hopeless weather conditions,
average conditions for
solarization and brilliant
when it comes to geothermal storage,
which is the best possible technology
and is really safe,
renewable and can be used
in many ways.
Mrs. Mariusz, but Iceland has geysers
on the surface, and we have geothermal
sources at a depth of 2-3 km.
We have the lowest
depth of sources in Europe, sir.
We have the lowest depth.
We have to finish our hearing.
Thank you very much for the interview.
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman
and we are already inviting our listeners
next week.

[music]
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial, Foundation Więcej Mądrości.
Today we're considering changes in geological law.
Mr. Mariusz, what's the score?
What did you hear there again?
I remembered our conversation about the American civil protest against the Bud Light beer.
And I wonder if such a civil protest could happen in Poland,
because we're dealing with a law that is coming into life,
which is causing a lot of controversy.
And I think we're just at the beginning of this road.
Specifically, it's about the renewal of mining law,
especially about the regulations on the so-called strategic deposits.
And according to these regulations, if the main geologist of the country decides that something in the ground,
some minerals or other deposits are strategic for the country,
then the owner of this land will not be able to put anything on it.
And the fundamental question, Mr. Mariusz,
do we have to protect our natural resources deposits so much?
It's not about the fact that you can't build on your own land.
It's about the fact that there may even be instruments
of taking this land from us and passing it on to anyone.
Answering the question, I think that whatever you call it,
""protection of deposits"", it doesn't make any sense to me.
There are currently operating mechanisms of practically perfect protection of all Polish deposits
through three stages.
First, concessions and licenses necessary for mining, transporting, selling and processing deposits.
Second, the level of costs, technology and knowledge that must be possessed
to be able to mine anything on any affordable scale.
And safety and environmental regulations that prevent mining of any deposits
in places that are not properly prepared for it.
What if someone has something under the house of a depositor?
Nickel, gold?
What would happen if one of the Poles had his own oil shale?
Mr. Mariusz, I see it differently.
It seems to me that the intention of the authorities is that some Polish man,
the proverbial Kowalski, who has a piece of land above the deposit of a valuable resource,
did not block the construction of a mine because, for example, he will not agree to sell this land.
But why would he sell it if it's his land?
And according to any logic, it should be his deposit.
But if he has a plot of land that has a hectare, and the deposit takes up hundreds of hectares,
and it is not worth it to create a large enterprise and buy it in the neighborhood,
it is more likely that someone will buy it, and he does not agree and blocks a large investment.
That's exactly what it's about.
So let's say you have a hectare of land, you sow beets on it.
At this point, someone comes and says, ""Listen, I'll give you a million zlotys.
Let's apply logic, let's apply facts, let's apply examples from life.
Will someone, having a huge wealth to choose from, choose a heavy plow on a piece of land?
Let's be honest, a hectare of land will not give you any great maintenance.
These are the laws of the economy, sir, that those who should have resources,
who have the best methods of using them.
And here we have the principle of communism.
The party always knows better what is good for the citizens,
and this stupid citizen, let him be stupid and poor, will be deported.
And this is how his millionaire career ends.
What is better for Poles is probably obvious.
What is better for Poland?
Well, this matter may be an example of a certain diversity of interests
between an individual person and the interest of the nation.
But I wanted to ask you earlier about another thing, Mr. Mariusz.
The provisions on land confiscation have existed for a long time and have been applied.
There are even special laws that allow the confiscation of land for the construction of roads,
for the construction of gas pipelines.
Why does this law arouse such great controversy?
And it really does, because a social protest against this law is born on the Internet.
Let's add not only on the Internet.
From what I know, at all stages of social consultation
there was a negative, clearly negative, opinion of all the committees.
And yet, however, we see the procedure of this law, which is a very bad signal for me.
Because if we live in the so-called democracy, the people's government,
then if the people say clearly ""no, it's a stupid idea"", ""no, we don't want this"",
""we don't like it at all"", and the authorities still proceed,
then we are at odds with the idea of ​​democracy.
What you have said so far, the confiscation laws work,
but this is a very important difference that has never been before.
The construction of a gas pipeline or roads is a very unique matter,
rarely used, because how many pipelines will you build?
These are not large, dense networks.
Moreover, it is easy to predict, there are long-term processes.
These are not things that would concern most Poles, let's be honest.
Here we are talking about a scandalously small fraction.
But if we are talking about deposits, Poland has some deposits in two-thirds.
Everywhere.
In short, we are talking about practically the entire Polish territory.
We are not talking about some minimal, symbolic, not even percentage.
Here we are talking about something that may potentially concern the crushing part of our country.
It can happen to me, my family, in my city, to my children.
This is a completely different scale of phenomena, really on a completely different level.
Let's put a stop here, but we'll come back to our discussion in a moment.

Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial advisor of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Today we are thinking about issues that are more legal, perhaps, than economic.
We started with the issue of the conflict of interests of the individual and the whole of society.
I listened to the explanation of the Minister of Climate, who justified the need to introduce these regulations in the Sejm.
He said that the protection of our strategic resources is the interest of the whole country, the whole of society.
Without special regulations, you said that it would not be possible to expand on a large scale,
but we are implementing a central communication port and without special regulations
regarding the expansion of these areas, which are very controversial,
it would probably not be possible to build this airport.
Airport, fast rail lines - we will all use it someday.
I return to the question, are such regulations not necessary?
From the point of view of economic logic, in this statement I see only the demagogy.
These are more emotional, psychological, manipulative arguments, I would even dare to call them.
Please pay attention to the scale of the phenomenon.
How many central communication ports do we have in Poland?
We don't have any yet, but there will be one.
Well, you understand, so we are talking about really individual situations.
I want to emphasize to you that so far all actions that have concerned the expropriation of citizens from their property, from their lands,
have concerned scandalously small, even individual examples on a minimal scale.
But here we are talking about something that potentially concerns practically the entire surface of Poland.
You must not apply the same rules to something so extremely different.
Moreover, I am still unable to grasp the argumentation of what this strategicity of the complex is.
What complexes are we talking about? What strategies are we talking about?
If so far we have voluntarily destroyed all the branches of industry in Poland,
where there is shipyard industry, casting, car factories, mines, food processing, sugar factories.
All these areas are in total, crushing disappearance.
And suddenly someone starts telling me about strategic interest of the law and so on.
Wait, wait, wait.
So first you destroy all possible strategic actions of ours, and now suddenly you want to protect something that is not there?
I would like us to go a level deeper, because under the slogan ""interest of the nation"" there are some specific interests, specific benefits.
I see in all this the benefit of mining companies, enterprises that will be able to easily reach the deposit.
Who else will benefit from this?
Let's think for a moment.
A poor official, because officials earn absurdly low money, will have a tool to take over the price set by himself for every piece of Polish land.
Not only that, because there will be no possibility of appeal from these decisions.
There will be no court, appeal, nothing.
This is a completely different level of regulations.
A state official who is only an employee there will be able to decide on such serious matters,
being sure that these lands will contain some exceptionally valuable deposits.
Who do we deprive of these deposits, this property?
Well, almost all citizens, owners, Poles.
Who will these valuable deposits go to?
To the one who will have an impact on the official.
Who appoints and dismisses the official, he rules the whole land in Poland.
Do you understand now the dangerous economic mechanism?
Not only will it be possible to take over this land, but it will also be taken over for free.
Who will pay for taking over this property?
Citizens.
In short, we will steal citizens from the pockets of other citizens.
The Poles will pay for it.
And we have a combination, the richest companies that have gigantic interests, only they can actually make such investments.
And poor officials who can take any pieces of land with any deposits underneath.
Even if it goes to, in quotation marks, Polish entrepreneurs, let's ask ourselves a simple question.
Who in Poland really has the biggest money?
The answer is probably one, because now we do not have to worry.
There are so many materials from the IPN, historical publications, that we already know.
These were people associated with communist governments and special services, including the mafia.
That is, thieves with political systems.
Who else built such a powerful fortune to be able to exploit mega investments with deposits?
To attract great specialists, the best in the world of equipment and so on.
And let's leave it all with what I have already said so far.
So we have poor officials who have absolute impunity.
As I said, there is no way out of this.
No court will verify it.
No other sentence, some appeal, experts, experts.
No, no one.
If the official takes a peck, it is more sacred than the Pope said.
And on the other hand, we have super-rich, indispensable people.
I am not asking if there will be pecks, I am just asking when and how big.
This is a mechanism that we create ourselves, which will be, by definition, a crushingly corrupt mechanism.
And in my opinion, this is one of the most economically dangerous laws in Poland.
I invite you to the next part of our conversation after the break.

What is the game, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial, Foundation Więcej Mądrości.
Today we are considering changes in geological law.
It sounds very specialized, but it is a very interesting topic.
I hope our listeners will be convinced of this.
The law we are talking about, the change in geological law, is an example of a change in law that comes into being at a very fast pace.
Such situations have already happened in the Sejm.
The work on this law began in May, because it was passed in May.
At the moment, it is already approved, directed to the Senate, and is waiting for any amendments from the Senate.
All this indicates that in two months this law will come into effect.
It can be seen that the rulers are effective, they can actually introduce such changes.
Mr. Mariusz, is this an element of building a strong state, as the ruling team is currently talking about?
First of all, I really see an incredible acceleration in legislation of such suspicious laws, in my opinion.
I know dozens of necessary Polish regulations waiting for months, and some for years, to be implemented in the Sejm.
Why this one? Why now?
In the second paragraph of your speech, you used the word ""strong state"".
Yes, yes, I had the definition in my head. A state that effectively implements the intentions of the rulers.
And the rulers realize the will of society, because they are elected in democratic elections. In short.
According to these definitions, Switzerland would be a weak state, Russia, North Korea would be a strong state.
I do not agree with this, because in my opinion it is exactly the opposite.
A strong state is a strong economy, and a strong economy is possible only thanks to strong citizens.
Strong economically, strong morally, which is very rarely said at all.
That the rules of morality, religious rules, matter. We are talking about money, GDP, the army.
A strong state is a state that has a strong society, and the key here is the middle class.
If you have a strong middle class, then it will always be a strong state.
Practically in the states I mentioned, which would fall under this definition, from the way you presented it, a strong state, there is no such thing as a middle class at all.
There are oligarchs and total poverty and suffering.
And these are weak states. In Switzerland, you won't even notice whether the prime minister has changed or not.
In a weak state, when a dictator dies, everything falls apart in one day.
The whole economy, economy, social systems, everything falls apart.
I will move on to the next topic, because all your statements result in fear of the state.
Fear of state interference, fear of government interference, too much influence of the state on the citizen.
But are these fears justified? Let's move on to the example of water.
Water, which is the most popular and basically the most needed raw material, because we all need water every day.
It is legally protected and I think it is quite effective.
It is not possible to pollute it, its intake is regulated by state institutions.
There are Polish waters responsible for the fact that we actually manage water.
The supervision of the water economy is done by the Union, because soon we will all have to guarantee that water in taps will be drinkable.
And that every citizen will have easy and free access to drinking water.
Isn't that proof that international regulations, international structures, force the state apparatus to act in accordance with the interests of society?
Ask the elderly who are still alive, if it was ever possible in their mind, in any form, to pay for drinking water.
Now I'm sure you're spending thousands of zlotys on water to drink, to use it, to bathe, to do laundry, etc.
Something that used to be a generally available good, common, now you have to buy in a bottled form.
I know that in many countries in the world, if you go to a restaurant, you can drink as much water as you want for free.
And we are talking about much poorer countries than Poland.
There are regulations that depend on the so-called fixed cost of water services,
corresponding to the available resources of groundwater and the average low flow of the so-called multi-year.
This means that if someone admits that these resources are smaller and these average flows have changed, they can charge us any fee.
Because a new system of charging these costs comes in.
We do not have control over water at all as citizens. The only exponent is the state.
It rules, it gracefully allows us to use water on our own land for now, but only in a limited range, because it is very precisely described in the water law.
The fact that you can water your garden or drink water from your own well is only the good will of the owner, who you are not.
The essence of living organisms is just functioning on the basis of water.
At this point, I suspect that all listeners pay for this water and I dare to suspect that we will pay more and more.
Mr. Mariusz, to be clear, it is about free drinking water. We use a lot more water than we drink.
It is obvious that we have to pay for the cost of providing this water.
However, according to the new regulations, water can be one of the strategic resources of the state.
Exactly, you understand now that if we have some water resources under our branches,
not only will we not be able to use them, what else can someone give us?
Because he will say, ""Listen, but according to our data, drinking water resources are being reduced, so they are now critically important to us.""
And unfortunately, this will be true. And if there are any deposits somewhere, these deposits will be taken over.
If they take our water now, what will we have left?
What will we keep the value for ourselves, for our children?
If we do not have a guarantee that what you have, you will still have.
And with this pessimistic accent, we will come to the end of today's broadcast, but we invite you to the next meeting in a week.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier. Thank you very much for the interview.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman. See you.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial advisor, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
A few days ago, just a few days ago, the whole world followed the march to Moscow,
in the performance of the famous Wagner group of private troops fighting in Ukraine so far.
However, few people noticed the information that also appeared in the world media,
that right after the end of this march, Russian diplomats flew to a few African countries,
where, as it turns out, Wagner's troops are also stationed.
My question is, what is the private military group doing in Africa
and why did Putin send his diplomats there?
Good question.
They are there, above all, supporting dictatorial governments,
corrupted governments in African countries, at least 10 of which I know of.
First of all, they are engaged in the acquisition of mines,
the sale of precious minerals, mainly gold, diamonds,
and murdering oppositionists, murdering political opponents, suppressing riots.
Well, such normal international activity.
All countries do it, not just Putin.
Does this money go to the Russian state's budget or is it consumed in some other way?
I assume that here and here.
We do not have any specific data, for obvious reasons, of course, because the money is illegal,
but at the same time, this money goes to the maintenance of the whole country,
because we are talking about really gigantic money here.
And of course, on the occasion, they lead to a gigantic wealth,
a tiny group of those people who are in power.
In February this year, in Khartoum, Sudan,
the military, controlling the shipment sent to Moscow,
the shipment that was supposed to contain the cake,
found gold, and in huge quantities, about tons, according to Western media.
The case was silenced, since such information has already appeared officially.
Why did the United States or the European Union not influence the cut of such a source of funding for Moscow?
Why would they influence?
All the greats knew about it for years and used these phenomena in many ways.
And who would actually oppose it?
The purchase of a EU official, the purchase of Biden,
who has a son of a total scoundrel and a catcher who has been taking millions of new catchers from all over the world for years,
including from Ukrainian gas and fuel oligarchs.
I don't think there is anyone in the highest ranks of power who would have the clear conscience
to act and break such a thieving silence.
Presently, when it all came out in the open, they will probably have to do something,
but so far it has been like a mafia, where the boss's minions can hate each other,
and even kill, but they never stop doing common interests and stealing others together.
As for these flights, there were more than one, only a dozen of them, which we know for sure, of course.
In addition, a funny fact, the gunners then got a call from a high-ranking official
that they were supposed to let go of this plane and gold, and that's exactly what happened.
From the available data, I know that we are talking about at least 32 tons of illegally mined gold from Sudan alone.
It is estimated that the profits from the gold mine in Central Africa are a billion dollars a year.
And these examples can be multiplied, because there is a lot of it.
Since it has worked so far, Prigozhin had his share in this interest,
and I have his group and his soldiers too, why did he need such an act of rebellion against his superiors in Moscow,
which we all observed a few days ago?
What did he want to gain? Did he actually go to Moscow for justice, as it was said about his march,
which sounds quite absurd anyway?
Knowing history, we know that private military groups rebelled when they stopped getting paid.
What happened this time? What can we guess?
No, he didn't need it at all, because it was absolutely necessary to him.
It was literally a matter of his survival, in my opinion.
From July 1, his fighters were to move to the official army, which would mean that he would not be needed there at all.
And that's when he became the hero of the whole of Russia.
He was welcomed with flowers on the streets and in my opinion it worried Putin.
He was also heard about Prigozhin's political ambitions and really strong support in the so-called force resorts,
which, of course, is not to be talked about, but the Putin's government did not like it very much, especially in recent years.
From what I learned, Putin allowed Shoigu to quietly pacify the largest military force that Prigozhin had.
Prigozhin and Shoigu, the Minister of Defense, have hated each other for years, because Prigozhin did not share the loot with the entire military mafia.
I think that's the right word.
And they were so desperate for it that they killed hundreds of his fighters for their purposeful, incompetent and even almost sabotage decisions.
Of course, there is money involved, because Prigozhin received about a billion dollars, at least in the last year, which Putin himself admitted at one of the conferences.
We are only talking about legal payments from the budget, and I assume that there was a lot more of it from illegal money,
as we mentioned, drawn from these mines in Africa, and also from dozens of legally established businesses,
where one of them is called MIDAS, which probably says a lot about what it does and what profits it gives.
In my opinion, the explanation for the whole mystery of this rebellion is the fight of two poles in the proper Putin's power,
that is, the army and special services, mainly the FSB, of course.
So far, Putin has kept them more or less in a balanced opposition, that's why he could rule for so long.
It seems that he is losing control of them now, and I assume that one of these forces will win, probably by defeating Putin and killing dangerous opponents,
and subjugating all the less important ones.
Time for a break, we'll be back in a moment to our conversation.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial advisor, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"",
today we are talking about the backstage of international politics.
Exactly, Mr. Mariusz, we are running an economic program.
Let's focus now on what impact these events may have on the economic situation in Russia, Ukraine, and all over the world.
I think it's colossal.
From what I can see, the current world order is that Putin literally kept the military elite and special services in check.
That's why he could get rich and kill whoever he wanted, with the silent consent of the world powers.
His current power is in turmoil.
The question is how he will go back to the past.
Because the fact that he will go back to the past is already a given to me.
The way it will happen will define what will happen in the world and the world economy.
Does that mean that there may be chaos in Moscow after Putin's departure?
It will definitely happen, it's undisputable, of course.
The question is what will happen, because there may be scenarios that are really very different,
and I will say that there may be scenarios that are absurdly terrifying, or even innocent.
I understand that this will not affect the euphoria in the world's stock exchanges and the sudden increase in the share price
and all kinds of economic ventures for development.
Absolutely not, of course, you are right.
If it would affect something, it would be rather a decrease in the price of gold, currencies that are considered to be an escape method,
or certain real estate that can also be perceived as a safe haven for dangerous times.
So I would lean more in that direction.
We are definitely not talking about economic development, we are definitely not talking about economic stabilization,
or even destabilization, or the threat of the current system's economic sustainability.
Foreign media also wrote that Prigozhin has contact with the Ukraine's interview.
His whole pooch weakened not only Putin, but actually Russia, Russia's position, Moscow's position.
Could he somehow cooperate with Kiev, with the Ukrainian authorities?
He definitely has contacts, but the thesis that he acted on Kiev's order is like saying that a neighborhood hooligan
turned to the boss of the mafia because he listened to the orders of the neighbor's child.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Ukrainian special services were not and are not, in my opinion, independent enough to be able to act on this scale.
For decades, they have been united with Russian services and were completely subject to them.
Currently, these services are superior to them, not only because of the crushing advantage of knowledge and technology,
but also, or maybe above all, a gigantic financial impact on the entire operation, or even on the existence of Ukraine.
If not for the interview, military equipment and money from the USA, Ukraine would be conquered by Putin's troops almost without a fight.
Everyone knows about it, and the fairy tales about brave fighters and victorious troops of Ukraine are media myths for the crowds.
Because even with all the military aid and hundreds of billions of dollars, they are not able to mount one offensive against Putin.
Let me remind you that Putin sent about 100,000 troops to 300,000 Ukrainian troops,
and his plan was to win the victory in Kiev in two weeks, as far as I remember.
This shows that this is a really crushing advantage, and we are not talking about numbers, equipment, etc.
No, what it would be like now, without the help of the USA, we can see by looking at this attack from 2014,
the conquest of Crimea and those eastern republics.
At that time, the Ukrainian troops were literally crushed, practically without losses.
Only now Putin is not fighting the Ukrainian army, but practically with the entire NATO,
where hundreds of billions of dollars are pumped, the most modern equipment and the most modern military, satellite and intelligence systems.
But maybe in the last 10 years, the morale of Ukrainian soldiers ready to defend their homeland has increased so much?
Without a doubt, you are right, morale has certainly increased, but look from the point of view of economists,
Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
There are unofficial data, rankings, and they are really practically at the very bottom.
Anyway, right next to Russia.
Only in Russia there is one strong leader who keeps the record of all oligarchs, special services, troops, etc.
In Ukraine, it is the opposite.
The oligarchs are kept on the leash of all officials.
Besides, Zelensky was such a man, near Moyski, the greatest Ukrainian oligarch.
And all the last documents came out, where he received tens of millions for his presidential campaign.
So he was constantly financed by this oligarch.
Recently, also corruption cases, how he traded during the war, that is, he allegedly defended his homeland,
and at the same time he traded with Putin, he was stealing, he was making profits, he could not get rid of a gigantic property.
The whole fairy tale about this brave, fighting Ukraine does not stick to any facts.
We know that this is a corrupt country, without any power structure, no functioning apparatus.
And this is an absolute standard.
This is how the whole country has been working for years, and suddenly you want to say that people have experienced a moral renewal?
The apparatus of power has been renewed, the offices have been renewed, the officials have been thieves and have become decent people.
What a miracle!
We will go to this thread, Mr. Mariusz, after the break.
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
What is the game, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation Więcej Mądrości.
Mr. Mariusz, the world economic game is now starting to revolve around who and on what principles will rebuild Ukraine.
It is known that huge money will go there and huge businesses will be done there.
It turned out quite recently that the biggest world giants will do it - BlackRock, JP Morgan.
Such companies like to earn money. Ukraine needs to invest hundreds of billions of dollars just to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure.
How to reconcile that some will want to earn money and others will have to pay for it? Who will pay for it?
Everywhere where the USA was leading freedom, peace and democracy, incredible misfortunes and tragedies were coming out.
There were gigantic affairs of American companies, where the company, in quotation marks, registered in a private house, had billions of dollars, for example, to build a network of hospitals.
It turned out that it did not build any. There are no billions of dollars, because they were very nicely spent, but there are still no hospitals.
And there were such rates that you could do the highest class of world medical standards.
This is what this reconstruction looks like. I suspect that it will be identical to Ukraine. Gigantic money was defrauded.
They are defrauded all the time, because it did not end.
And if we say that the same people, the same government apparatus will do the so-called reconstruction, then the question is only how it will be bad.
Because gigantic money will go, there will be no reconstruction, it will be on paper, it will be symbolic.
So be realistic. In my opinion, there will be no reconstruction. There will be a confiscation.
For the money, the best factories, the best districts, the best settlements, the best tourist locations will be taken over.
And there private investors will rebuild it beautifully.
Let's see what Grozny looks like now, after Putin practically leveled it with the ground.
It's a wonderful city.
Until the owners became the right people.
This is not a profit, this is a brutal attitude to profit.
I would call it theft, because it is not a business.
I would look more at how much fraud will be under the cover of the reconstruction of Ukraine.
And I would not expect miracles that something decent will be made of this money.
Unless it will be built up and sold for, for example, one hryvnia.
Probably such things will be, but they will be some very big scams. I suspect that we will soon find out about gigantic scams, gigantic scams.
You mentioned earlier about the son of President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, who a few years ago was in the holding board of the Ukrainian oligarch.
Well, no one even hid that he was invited to this board for heavy money to gain sympathy in America.
Among other things, his father, who was then the Vice President of the United States, was responsible for contacts with Ukraine.
These were the foundations for what is happening now.
How the son of the Vice President of the United States was employed is a form of corruption, contact forming.
How to call it, how to define it?
You know what, let the lawyers take care of it, how to call it.
Because the level of financial scams, scandalous behavior is unimaginable.
In my opinion, this whole war is possible only because this entire fuel, military, financial complex wanted it.
Otherwise, Putin would never have attacked. It is obvious, after all.
So someone agreed to be attacked. Someone agreed to send hundreds of billions of dollars there.
Someone agreed to buy out land in Ukraine, which is now being taken over by gigantic amounts by American entities.
So it looks like a very big financial operation.
Including personal involvement of the highest officials, including the President of the United States.
Putin is known to be a bandit, a thief.
But without the active help of the greatest powers, the most important entities in the world, nothing would happen.
In Poland, there is an opinion that Ukraine should be supported for moral reasons, as an attack on the fact that we will go there after the end of the war to rebuild.
We will run normal businesses, help people get back to normal life.
Do we even have a chance to do anything there in a situation when it is already somehow distributed and arranged beyond our heads?
You know, we always have a chance. The only question is whether this chance is realistic.
I believe that normal entrepreneurs will not make money on it.
Maybe there will be individual cases for small money, some pennies that will be left somewhere, left before the fair.
But they will definitely earn the elected people.
Because please remember that what I said about special Ukrainian services is true about special Polish services.
They were also under crushing influence of the Russian services.
These people did not die, let's check the date of birth.
They are still alive.
Only that for 30 years there is a new generation.
As the old king lives, the new one will not rule.
Those people have great influence, they have money for everyone, they have a lot of money that they earned very quickly and completely not monitored by any services.
Well, it's not a coincidence, sir, and no one is probably naive enough to believe in such cases.
So if we know that there is a powerful force that can kill you, can bribe you, can blackmail you.
And I want to tell you that we can omit it because there are new ones.
Well, no, these new ones have to get along with these old ones until those old ones leave, go to prison or die.
You have to count on them.
Just like we talked about Putin.
There are these forces.
Putin already has 70-year-old grandfathers, but they still keep everything in their pockets.
It's a shame because there is really such a generational change between them and these fights between the resorts.
They still don't rule, sir, and they still make these gigantic interests.
Thank you very much for the conversation, Mr. Mariusz, see you next week.
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
See you.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

[music]
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What do you want to hear again?
We'll get to the topic of our today's broadcast in a moment, but first a little anniversary, our anniversary.
Behind us are 25 issues of our economic magazine.
For half a year we have been talking on the radio about the economy.
We haven't exhausted the topics for conversation?
Indeed, it's going fast.
And I have more topics than time for listening to them.
It's coming, life brings topics.
Mr. Mariusz, our listeners, please let us bring you a little closer.
You speak very categorically about the economy, you have clear views.
You often criticize the so-called recognized media authorities, which are present in the main media.
As far as I know, you are not engaged in scientific or research activities at the university.
Was it a conscious choice to avoid the university?
Indeed, I once made the decision not to follow the path of a scientific employee,
because I knew the world of schools, universities and lectures quite well.
Because for many years I taught at universities, I taught at schools.
But never as an employee, because at the same time I always worked in business, I took various positions.
At the university I taught as an external expert.
And I was guided by this, to do what I wanted to be done, by giving someone knowledge.
So without nonsense, without rules, just to pass something that has practical value,
from which you can take advantage.
And I will be honest, I had dozens of cases when my former students met me after years
and they hooked me up on the street.
""Oh, thank you, how useful it was for me.""
I was really shocked many times.
Because this is the reason for me why I did not enter this environment.
I got to know it too much, I spent too much time in it and I did not want to be a part of it.
But if you were happy with teaching with young people, why did you give up?
I did not give up.
It's just that you can't do everything at once.
I still teach business courses, not necessarily always with young people.
You know, as usual, I teach either some specialists or some management staff.
They are not teenagers, you know.
However, it also gives a lot of satisfaction that you can share knowledge,
which is gained in great effort and effort.
Years spent in books, years of analysis, years of practical experience stand behind it.
It all comes with pain, suffering, effort.
Others drank beer, I sat in books, others drank beer, I worked on two or three stages at once.
You know, something for something.
Many times in our conversations you refer to your life experience,
to practical knowledge, professional experience.
Please tell us who you were doing professionally.
I love knowledge and I would like to know and understand everything that surrounds us and what is in us.
Because in my opinion, this is the key to knowledge.
At the same time, as I mentioned, I have been doing business training and advice for about 25 years.
Lectures, including lectures at universities.
During this time, I followed a professional path as a senior manager,
I go to positions in the company's management.
I go through all the stages, from an ordinary specialist to management and marketing, to being a president.
At the same time, I also had some scientific ambitions.
However, as I went deeper into the university world, I saw that there is little knowledge, but a lot of systems and policies.
These were my experiences.
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe somewhere else it is different, but I'm talking about my experiences.
For example, a professor at the University of Wrocław met my doctoral theses.
From one of them I heard that it was cool, but too practical.
To be honest, I didn't believe my ears.
The promoter said that I just have to give more quotes from the books of these professors,
so that they would look at my scientific theses.
So it doesn't matter how meaningful or useful a doctorate is for the world,
but it matters how many quotes I give from the books of those who will assess it.
I also had my time in politics, where I managed to go quite high.
I met a person whom I had only heard about on TV.
I learned a lot of secrets from the authorities, how to distribute positions.
I got rid of some political views, when I was working in politics.
And I look at people arguing about political views with a little bit of respect.
For me, they are like children who talk about things they really have no idea about.
I recommend everyone to enter politics, reach some level, then come back to me and we'll talk.
Fortunately, I withdrew from politics on my own terms, when I was at the top.
I wasn't forced to sell my principles for positions or pensions.
Another significant path is probably the one of an expert in the European Funds Affairs,
where I, as a practitioner, have been working on projects worth over 5 million PLN.
I even have one of the first books in Poland in this field,
where together with specialists from the Ministry and a few of my colleagues,
we wrote a manual, which became the basis for my studies.
I went through many industries for years.
Banking, leasing, telecommunications and IT companies.
Along the way, I met a few millionaires.
Fortunately, I even got to know you.
My motto is a quote I once read.
""A real man is in bad company only in two situations.
When he is very poor or very rich.""
So I take care not to be poor and I think that I won't become rich.
Mr. Mariusz, a moment of break.
A film by Jacek Makarewicz
A film by Jacek Makarewicz
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation,
today a bit more about yourself, but in connection with the economy, of course.
You had professional contacts with people responsible for running economic or economic policy.
What do you think about their competences and merit preparation?
Personally, I think that politics is a shambo, and there are not often golden caps.
I was not often delighted with the level of knowledge and skills of these people.
I'm not saying that there are no wise people there, because there are, they happen, I've met them,
but generally I was rarely delighted.
Usually, they were people who looked at things in a short-term way.
I will not ask you about your political views.
However, I guess you have a worldview, conservative, conservative approach to reality.
You do not fall for the following conventional changes in the world.
You do not particularly appreciate the growing influence of the state on the lives of citizens,
or the limitation of freedoms of economic activity.
In your opinion, can such views in Poland break through in the public debate?
Indeed, I laugh at myself that I have no political views, after years in politics.
But I have views on individual issues.
And if I were to assign myself somewhere, I will agree with your assessment that I am a free man of proven solutions,
not social or economic experiments based on some ideologies that have never proven that they work.
I have my own thesis on it, I called it the ""whirlpool of history"".
Strangely systematically, humanity goes through the same phases of views on social and ideological changes.
For me, it is a question of not whether such an opinion will ever break through, but when.
You talked about the ""whirlpool of history"", sometimes some views are on the top, others not.
Conservative views are probably experiencing a crisis now.
What are your social reactions to what you say?
Such conservative various kinds of theses.
I do not know if I have conservative theses, I just follow the facts.
I have met many people who rebel against scientific knowledge and facts, because it disturbs their beliefs.
But I have learned in life that there are only two situations.
Either I know something and someone who argues with it only shows his ignorance, and I confirm that what I know makes sense.
Or I do not know something and then someone argues with me and shows my ignorance, so that's why I get new knowledge.
That's why I'm open to discussions, views, new arguments. There is nothing to be afraid of.
Are other majorities open to such an approach to the debate?
Not necessarily, because gaining knowledge is an effort.
As I mentioned at the very beginning, people underestimate how much effort it costs to gain any knowledge, to learn any skills.
That's why most people go with such shortcuts, that is, some authority will tell you what you should know.
And you nod your head and try to live without even checking why this authority is telling you something.
It does not result from stupidity, but from a very normal scientific mechanism in the brain,
multiplying other people's solutions, multiplying other people's strategies.
And for centuries it was a very wise method.
Now, unfortunately, less and less, because the world is much more complicated.
That's why I think it's worth investing time and effort in gaining real, confirmed knowledge,
and it's better to avoid repeating someone's views, which may even look cool, even logically, even sensibly.
Your comments often lead to quite pessimistic conclusions.
You announced, among others, large deficits, for example, in the housing market,
because the debt of people who live in the country has been taken over by bankruptcy since mid-2023.
And the situation in the country seems to be stable.
The housing bubble, for example, has not broken.
Does that mean it's not there yet? Are we still waiting for it to break?
I would like to protest. First, because I have optimistic views.
I usually look optimistically at life, but I am aware of the data, so not everything always looks pink.
Large deficits in the real estate segment are a fact.
Because how do you explain that, with an official inflation rate of almost 20%,
housing prices do not go up by 20% every year, but sometimes even fall?
How do you explain the massive slowdown of the entire development industry?
In addition, if you added 20% to the value every year, how much would these prices be today?
So this decline is real and very measurable.
Let's add the arrival of 5 million Ukrainians.
No one knows how many really live here.
I estimate that probably half or even more have remained.
Recently I was in Warsaw at the Money Museum and most of the people were Ukrainians.
Fortunately, I knew Russian, so there was no problem for me to communicate with them.
But it was shocking for me. I was in the center of Copernicus and I heard Russian all over the place.
This can be seen with the naked eye. You don't have to be an economist or a statistician to see that a lot has changed in our economy.
How does it affect several million people who have to live somewhere?
Let's add that these people cost us billions a year.
Where do these money come from? How will it all affect our economy in the long run?
It will always be revealed.
Mr. Mariusz, the second break, as always in our audition.

You're right, it's hard to compare.
But in my opinion, it's not a good direction.
What you've mentioned is something people had anyway.
There was care, for example, related to families.
Now families are broken up, scattered, there is no integration.
Once families were very close.
And this care was just there.
Now you will die alone in some care home.
And once you died in the vicinity of your loved ones.
And of course, we have to pay for it.
It's hard to work to get something worse than before.
It's hard to work to get something worse than before.
How many hours a day do animals ""work"" to survive?
How many hours a day do animals ""work"" to survive?
You compare the life of a modern man.
It's terrifying.
You don't have time for rest, relax, spend time with your family.
How much do you have to work to pay for things you don't want?
You have to work to pay higher taxes,
to pay more parking spaces.
To see nature, you have to pay.
When you just watch it.
Now you go and pay a tax on the air you breathe on vacation.
You pay for the water you drink.
You didn't pay for it once.
Water, air, the biggest beggar had it for free.
There were no such developed office structures.
You go to the zoo and see a gigantic office building
with thousands of people who don't know what they're doing there.
And we can check how much it costs.
More and more things are paid for.
Someone makes money for it.
And you have to work for it.
Soon you will be paid for breathing.
You will breathe CO2, so they will impose a tax on you like on a mine.
Thank you very much for today's conversation.
Thank you for your attention today and for the six months we spent together.
We also invite you to contact us
and leave questions to our expert.
We are waiting for you at 536-286-286.
Thank you very much, Mr. Mariusz.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, and the program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

[music]
What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
Well, Mr. Mariusz, I would like to say ""Uff"".
Economic indicators are becoming very optimistic.
Your black promises have not been fulfilled.
Inflation is falling. And it's pretty fast.
The latest readings say 11.5%,
and further predictions even say that next year they will fall to 8-9%.
In fact, the reality is beginning to overlap more and more with the predictions of experts
who said that inflation will fall.
The NBP president Adam Glapiński has ceased to be a subject of jokes.
Well, just wait until the credit stock rate drops and the euro is still cheap,
so all this seems to be announcing the end of the crisis.
Is prosperity returning, Mr. Mariusz?
Well, let's start with what didn't work out according to you from my predictions.
Well, the prices of apartments in larger cities were supposed to fall.
Generally, the drops were a few percent.
In most cities, the price level was probably maintained,
and in some even slightly increased.
OK, so we determined that the prices have fallen.
It's hard to call it an unfulfilled prediction.
I remember saying that prices should drop by about 30%.
That would be good, healthy and sensible.
Just like you have a chart of the economic cycles,
all the economic effects are fluctuating.
It's like a wave of growth,
it reaches the peak, it starts to fall, it reaches the bottom, and the cycle repeats.
There is always a moment in these economic cycles
when we reach a certain peak, i.e. the highest prices,
and suddenly it starts to fall, to shrink, to fall.
Until now, we have had prices rising practically non-stop for several years.
Even galloping.
When everything was growing, all the media were talking about growth, about development.
I said no, no, no, it's bad, it's going to fall, it's unfulfilled.
And it really happened, as I predicted.
Why didn't it fall by 30%, not by 3%?
These are the issues we will discuss today.
You mentioned that it's better because inflation is falling.
How do you know that inflation has fallen?
Because some official announced it?
The decline in inflation is a sign that it is better.
No, unfortunately, it is not better, it is worse.
Any economist will tell you that the inflation is lower,
it does not mean that the economy is better, but that it is worse.
Mr. Mariusz, but customers feel more stable.
When low inflation is stabilized, customers feel more confident,
it is easier for them to predict their economic movements,
expenses, and they feel more stable and are more willing to take risky decisions.
What's wrong with that?
We have the worst indicators in the entire EU for 25 years, sir.
For the last, practically, 20-odd years,
we had the EU average inflation rate
fluctuating around 2%
Two, sir.
Then it shot up to over 10 on the EU scale,
now it is estimated at over 6.
So we have three times more than in the last 20-odd years.
It's bad, very bad, sir.
It's the worst in decades.
If it was almost 20%, and now it is reported that it is about 10%,
and suddenly you want to tell me that in a year this inflation has dropped by half,
well, if we have such geniuses in the economy who can do such things,
why can't the whole world do it?
How is it possible that you can improve your indicators in a few months?
At the same time, we are talking about a period when the entire energy and fuel markets went crazy.
It was the worst period in many, many, many decades, sir.
Not only that, we are talking about a situation where we keep millions of so-called refugees in our pot.
It costs billions.
Where did we get this money from?
We don't have them, we owe them.
And in this situation, we have greatly increased the efficiency of the economy, we have become better, and the economy is better?
The fact that the indicator of inflation may fall does not mean that prices will fall.
In general, declining inflation is not declining prices.
It is not a good economy.
Inflation, sir, is a comparison of prices to base prices, to the base year.
In short, it has worsened less than it has worsened recently.
And this is the hook with inflation.
And the last thread, you mentioned that Lapinski is no longer a reason to joke.
I understand that all these affairs with his so-called courtyards, which had a salary of 60,000 or more, were cleared up.
And they were unable to document on what basis they are actually so well paid.
When we have evidence that they are inadequate for this position.
And how they look, everyone can look in Google and see and draw their own conclusions.
I understand that other things have been clarified, for example, that Mr. Glapiński earns over a million a year,
of which the vast majority are the rewards that they pay there.
I understand that all this has been clarified, so we have nothing to laugh at.
But it didn't clear up, we got used to it.
Exactly, the fact that we are used to some pathology does not mean that it is better.
The same with inflation, the same with Glapiński, the same with the NBP forecast.
So I hope I answered your question.
Mr. Mariusz, I propose a moment of break.
A moment of break.
The end
The end
Mr. Mariusz, what is the game?
Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
Today we are arguing about whether it is better or not.
Let's go back to Mr. Czarny's announcements, preface.
And speaking of the crisis, we always have a preview of what happened in 1928,
what happened in 2008, i.e. great crises.
Meanwhile, we did not have a crash in the stock market, mass decline,
mass sales of commodity goods, there was no panic in the economy.
Mr. Mariusz, is this the effect of social and cover programs that the authorities introduced?
It came to all the predicted events, only on a smaller scale.
When everything started to fall apart, the government suddenly acted,
and so violently, as never before in the history of Poland.
The government has its price and we will probably have to pay for it, or our children.
You remember, I think, that I once said that this crash, this price drop,
would be long-term beneficial for Poles, and extending it will make us more indebted,
will reduce our chances of economic recovery.
We look at the phenomenon, we see how it is, and we can predict the logical consequences.
It's like you play billiards and you hit a bill,
and I can tell you that this bill will fly away unless someone catches it in the air,
because it didn't stop the hand. Someone disrupts the game.
In short, we are talking about state interventionism.
We are not talking about a free market economy,
because in Poland it just doesn't work like that in the most normal world.
This market is more or less disrupted, regulated.
I see it more as a communist economy, which has never left Poland.
For a moment, in some aspects, we had more freedom,
and this had a very positive impact on Poland.
People got rich, created businesses, very nice people created very nice businesses.
The fact that the communist party has never left Poland,
made the biggest unemployed people, who were associated with communist services.
That's why all these predictions, I always say that I can talk about the economy,
but I can't talk about political decisions.
They disrupt the economy.
Let's go back to the topic of state interventionism.
Let's consider the latest program, i.e. cheap loan, the so-called 2%.
A few days ago I was talking to a young resident of Krakow,
and he said that he was in a hurry to buy a flat, which he had been thinking about for a long time.
After government announcements that this program of cheap loan would be introduced,
the prices of flats in Krakow skyrocketed,
and offers simply began to disappear from the market.
He was waiting for the price to fall, he did not wait and now decides to hurry up and buy.
These were the assumptions, as you think.
Definitely yes. The question is who invented it.
The real estate market is one of the 3-4 businesses in the world,
which are dealt with by almost all the richest people in the world.
This probably really proves something.
We are talking about gigantic money here, gigantic influences, gigantic possibilities.
So this is the market that carries the most potential profit,
but also potential large influences of significant people.
Speaking openly, a lot of unclean games.
And we are not only talking about Poland, we are talking about the whole world.
We are generally talking about real estate markets everywhere.
This young man you mentioned, he can also observe only a minimum, such a micro scale of phenomena.
He does not understand why something is happening, why prices are rising, why they are falling.
And on the basis of this, he only makes decisions.
It is evidently visible here that we have a very disturbed real estate market.
In a scandalous way, I have no other word, scandalous.
All these decisions on the real estate market, you will notice, lead only in one direction.
That is, to push the money to an incredibly narrow group of rich people from the pocket of the whole society.
Because now we will only pay for others to get rich.
Normally, these prices should fall, let's be honest, 30-50% from now on.
I'm not saying it would be great, it would be brilliant, I'm just saying it would be normalization.
Imagine that everything costs on the real estate market up to 50% cheaper.
And how would this young man suddenly react to it?
Wow, now I can afford it, now I can, now suddenly these loans look real, now suddenly my financial opportunities fit into market realities.
In general, everything is changing.
So why is it not so?
Although all economic indicators show that this is exactly what should happen.
This is the natural consequence of the economy.
It's supposed to be.
Let's see why it is not.
Well, it's not because of a few decisions, as I said several times, political.
Whether it will be various types of aid, preferential programs, grants, relief.
Whether it will be the influx of millions, i.e. artificial construction, boosting the demand of the declining market on an incredible scale.
It suddenly turns out that prices will not fall, because how can they fall if you suddenly add to the demand for the supply of the whole system in Poland a few million new people who have to live somewhere.
And not only that, you steal your citizens by boosting the prices of apartments.
Let's face it, that's exactly what it's about.
And secondly, from the other pocket of the same citizen, he takes out money to pay for the whole operation, you steal it twice.
And this young resident of Krakow, as you said, he has no idea that he paid for it, that he will pay a high price for the apartment and for the next 10, 20, 30 years he will pay absurd high interest rates.
It all shows how abnormal this market is.
And if we look from the point of view of an economist, I see this - society pays for the enrichment of the super narrow elite.
We'll come back to this after the break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz? Economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Today we are talking about the latest current situation in the Polish economy and probably also in the world economy.
Let's go back to the topic of expensive apartments, cheap loans.
Mr. Mariusz, but this assistance program that we talked about, ""Cheap 2% Loan"" is aimed at a social group that needs apartments,
because these are young people with middle-income families who do not yet have these apartments, they need these apartments.
These are not people who buy to invest, to rent, to speculate on the housing market, to earn on rent.
What's wrong with the government helping such a social group?
Everything. Everything is wrong.
Because it is absurd, if you tell me as an economist, that I will forcefully take money out of the pocket of a hard-working citizen
to give it to someone who is not doing well, to buy something that he can't afford.
It's all wrong. It's wrong that he can't afford it, that the economy is unbalanced,
because suddenly why do middle-income people who work have nowhere to live?
It's absurd. Where do we live? The economy is not like that.
Taking money out of well-off people who can afford it, to finance some selected groups who can't afford it,
to things without which they won't die.
After all, these people live somewhere, live somewhere.
It's not like we save poor children from starvation. No!
It's not like the government suddenly invented perpetuum mobile and we have money that costs nothing to anyone.
They cost at least this unfortunate inflation if we pump the economy with artificial money.
They cost taxes, because where do they have to get this money from?
It's all worse for someone to buy something that he can't afford.
Secondly, we both know enough about Poland and Poles to ask only one question.
How much will they be overused?
Because I can generate scenarios in a matter of seconds, sir, how to go around these regulations?
So that rich people gain on it, not the poor.
Well, Mr. Marysia, but can't construction be treated as a swing wheel for the economy,
and this kind of loans as an investment in development?
Because every given apartment that will have a new owner will require furnishings, equipment.
These people will go to the shops, they will buy, buy, buy.
What is a development impulse for the economy?
I think that such construction is at least at the neck.
Housing construction is not an investment, it is an expense.
You will maintain it, so you will have additional expenses, so not only once you have taken money to buy this apartment,
then you have to pay rent, pay for energy, pay for repairs, pay a lot of things for this apartment to work.
So in fact, you pay twice, at the maintenance stage and at the purchase stage.
Where are your profits?
Status, psychology, you feel better, you boast to your friends, you will pick up girls easier.
If you don't make money on it, it's bad.
You said it was supposed to be a swing wheel of the economy.
How does the economy profit from financing, for example, apartments?
Because our economy is in debt.
We need factories, sir, not stadiums, warehouses, not fountains that build in all cities.
We don't need nicer apartments, we need a job.
A job, not a place of work given to us by Western corporations, which enter special conditions where they do not pay taxes,
but a place of work for Polish entrepreneurs.
Where are Polish entrepreneurs? They are dying like dinosaurs.
Poles are getting poorer as a nation.
The money you say is a swing wheel, it is money that flows stream to the pockets of foreigners, foreign funds, foreign companies.
We are robbed of this money.
If the economy is in debt, the last thing we want is apartments, fountains, stadiums.
These are election projects, not economic ones.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you very much for today's interesting conversation.
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości, led Krzysztof Strauchman.
See you.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation for More Wisdom,
today about debt, national, global.
I listened to the speeches of the president of the NIK, the highest board of control in the Sejm,
during the discussion of the last year's budget. My hair was a little frizzy on my head.
Our accumulated debt to the government and the self-government exceeded 1.5 billion zlotys last year.
I wanted to calculate how much it is for a person, I had a little problem with the calculation,
because zero is a lot, and it turned out that a statistic citizen
has 40.5 thousand zlotys in debt, which was drawn by the government or the self-government.
I don't even know if most citizens have such a fortune and so much money to pay it.
Mr. Mariusz, can you imagine a situation where a statistic Polish resident,
some Kowalski, will be responsible for the debt of the state with his fortune?
Indeed, shocking data, as you pointed out, and unfortunately, yes, we are incredibly in debt,
and Poles will pay for it.
Of course, most Poles live below any European standard.
Lying media tell jokes about economic growth, calculations manipulation,
and what is the average wealth on the slave plant?
A few rich people have everything, and a lot of slaves - nothing.
In 2022, the extreme poverty in Poland increased by 50% and is the highest in 7 years.
The minimum social in Poland reached 16 million people.
This means that almost 40% of the population is poor in Poland. Is this a good economy?
In my opinion, this is what an economic downturn looks like.
The worst is just ahead of us, so it's not the end.
We are now at the top of development, when we are at our best,
and it will be much worse.
As I read data at the beginning of the year,
almost 2 million Poles lived below the minimum standard.
Let us just remind you that we have a few million Ukrainians on the payroll,
who will soon start withdrawing money from the Polish budget for retirement.
This is not what is being thought about now, this is not yet there, because the payments are not yet coming, but they will be.
And this is an undisputed issue.
Mr. Mariusz, I will get into the word. The government keeps saying that this debt is growing, that money is needed for social programs,
for cover, pensions, 13 pensions, 14 pensions, for help with the Polish family.
Why don't these programs work?
Why did you forget to add that the Ukrainian families need the most money?
How much did we spend on helping Poles, how much on helping the million-strong Ukrainians?
The Polish government is supposed to take care of the Poles. This is its task, its only task.
Not the Romanians, Indians, Murshids, Afghans.
This is not the task of the Polish government.
Task number one is to take care of Poles and their well-being.
Not foreign corporations to develop here, to build networks.
This is not the task of the Polish government.
But let's compare Polish debt data with what is happening in Europe.
It looks like it's not so bad compared to other European countries.
In Poland, to pay off all our debt, we would have to spend all the money we earned for 6 months on debt repayment,
and food, for example, we would have to buy, I don't know, from savings.
Greece, which is the most debted country in Europe, has to work 2 years, 4 times longer, to pay off all its debt,
because the debt is twice as high as the GDP of this country.
Italy would have to work 18 months, France over a year.
Germany, which is an example of economic success for us, 8 months.
I remind you that we are 6 months.
Well, if everyone is in debt, why do we see the consequences of this?
You know it's fiction. No one has ever succeeded in such a method of debt repayment.
At least I haven't heard of such a case.
Bad government for decades is a bigger problem than it may seem.
It's not a matter of numbers, sir, because these data are only data.
I always remind myself in such situations, the first lecture in statistics.
When the professor said there are 3 types of lies.
Small lies, big lies and statistics.
It is impossible to get out of debt repayment with a simple method,
""Well, we don't spend anything for 6 months, we pay off our debts, we are a free country and we are doing great economically.""
Poland is not able to pay off its debts, because we are still in debt more and more.
We have an increasing and really drastically increasing level of debt.
We have more and more printed cash.
Why? What is it about?
No numbers will change anything here, no magic in numbers, no statistics, no book magic.
Nothing will help.
Mr. Mariusz, but in that case, everyone around is drowning, because even the United States,
the world power, currently has 31 billion dollars of national debt.
For a statistic American, it is 93 thousand dollars.
8 times more than the Polish debt to a statistic Pole.
So, if we are in such a good ""company"", then I think we will all go to the bottom, right?
I agree with the numbers, I agree with the conclusions.
The lean will die faster than the fat will lose weight.
The USA is in a terrible state, which I have been saying for many years, but it has such a gigantic potential in every aspect,
exceeding the crushing potential of Poland, that in the dark I will take their greater debt,
because they are not dominated by any neighbors and they can dominate most of their continent,
and even a significant part of the world if they want.
We do not have any military, political or economic power, even in a small Europe.
That's why these numbers don't matter at all.
Mrs. Mariusz, let's take a break and take a break.
The end
The end
What is the game, Mrs. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"" today about the debt.
In the national, global, as we said, in European countries, in the United States,
but let's take China for comparison, which also has a huge debt, 280% of GDP.
However, China is developing in an incredibly fast way.
Probably, this debt finances their development.
Can you avoid debt if the country wants to develop?
No economic, political or military data available about China is consistent with facts,
and this is the only thing we know for sure about China.
Data that shows a totalitarian communist regime are usually false,
because that's what totalitarianism and communism are based on.
On lies.
Moreover, the Chinese are not developing in any aspect.
It starts with the population, which is falling rapidly.
The whole industry is in a total decline.
On the streets, protests.
And we're talking about huge numbers of people.
Because they don't have paid in factories.
Because American companies, for example, Apple, are withdrawing from China.
Because of this, thousands of people from gigantic mega factories, do not have suddenly employment.
The banking sector, in which there are gigantic protests,
because banks literally rob the Chinese of their money, which they have in banks.
And the Chinese are not at all satisfied with this title.
Through the whole real estate sector, where it is a gigantic problem,
that people simply do not pay their bills for real estate.
Because real estate is not built.
Because the whole development industry is in a total decline.
And we're supposed to call it development?
And we know, for example, that all this fictional development of China
may turn out to be financed by the US citizens.
Through various corrupt schemes, as it turns out.
Reaching as far as the US President himself.
All this wave of this pseudo-development on all possible fronts
can turn out to be ordinary communist propaganda.
Of course, I did not mention the thing that is crushing.
That is, the total decline of the natural environment in China.
There, children in some places are not able to see the sun at all.
Never, practically.
You will not force a Chinese to drink tap water.
I will tell you this much.
China is not an example of any development.
In no way, at least to me.
Let's go back to our review of debts in individual countries.
And an extremely different example is Russia.
Whose public debt has recently amounted to about 20% of GDP.
Which is many times less than, for example, Poland.
Putin is actually a symbol of savings in this situation.
But, to be honest, I would not like to move to Russia and live there as an average citizen.
Because it seems to me that I live there extremely miserably.
Personally, I would not believe too much data on the GDP of Russia's debt.
It is certainly much more credible than this Chinese data.
But the poverty in Russia is huge and affects the vast majority of residents.
I think there is no doubt about it.
At least from the data I have reached.
There are such shocking data.
I would not say it literally, because I am not sure about it.
Because I have been saying this for several years.
For example, about 60% of people in Russia do not have access to running water and electricity.
And these were independent data.
These are terrifying information.
Only, there is a gigantic ""but"".
Most people in Russia have no idea how they can live.
They do not have a comparison, like Poles, for example.
What is the standard of living in Europe.
So they do not lack it.
They are used to it.
It may sound brutal, but these are the realities.
Not only that, about 75% of citizens do not have a passport at all.
So there is no way to compare this to the standard of living in other countries.
Massive Polish poverty, which I mentioned earlier, is, in my opinion, much more deplorable than the greater poverty, but Russian.
So people in Russia are simply poorer, but more satisfied, less unhappy than Poles.
Because they do not know how it can be, how a person can live in the 21st century.
Official data say that there are about 15 million Russians, or about 10% of the population, below the poverty line.
But, here I will surprise you, this is the lowest result since the early 90s.
Poland has the worst result in many years, when it comes to poverty.
And our results are getting worse, i.e. the Polish society is getting poorer.
Russian society, to make it funnier, is not getting poorer at all in recent years.
That's why Putin is so popular, despite who he is and what he does.
Because we know who this nasty, disgusting, thief, bandit and probably murderer is.
But he still has real support from people, because these people are living...
""Better"" is a bad word, but for them it's definitely better.
From what point of view is it living badly?
From the point of view of the Russian population, ordinary people, outside Moscow and Petersburg,
a few centers where there are really super-rich people and super-high standard of living,
they are just living better. And they are praising Putin for it.
Of course, there is corruption, there are all kinds of pathologies, that's clear.
But comparing to what was, sir, they are not unhappy at all.
This is amazing.
Mr. Mariusz, second break, I invite you in a moment.
""The end of the world""
""The end of the world""
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
We are talking about the debt of the state.
Actually, when did the debt of the countries start?
Were the countries always in debt?
No, of course not.
This is a new phenomenon in the history of the world,
where countries can exist when they are in total economic collapse.
And they can exist for decades.
And now it has become a global standard, not an event.
Once upon a time, a country that had no financial liquidity, just fell.
And it fell spectacularly.
Because if we didn't have money in the treasury, we didn't have money to pay the army.
Someone always set us up and there was no turning back.
He changed the authorities, overthrew them, or took over the territory.
And it was the end.
Weak countries did not exist, because something immediately became interested in them.
And it was such a natural selection in the forest.
Sick, ball-headed animals do not live in the woods, sir.
That there is no hospital for animals in the forest.
Because they are eaten.
Exactly, they are destroyed, eaten literally in days and hours.
If you are not strong, you can't defend yourself, you can't run away, you can't feed yourself, you die.
Now we have the cripples.
It was not like that before.
These people were either brutally straight, like the Spartan model, thrown off the cliff.
Very brutal, yes.
It was super healthy, super durable, but it worked.
Of course, there were many other techniques in the middle, less brutal.
But in general, it was about this.
If there is no healthy economy, healthy society, someone will take care of you and cure you.
So he eliminates these sick individuals, weak individuals or weak countries.
He puts the country in a strong structure and suddenly you became a strong country, although you didn't even want to.
Poland has experienced this many times.
When our country was falling apart in history, what happened?
The powers were taking over us.
No one allowed such a sick, weak country to exist.
Times have changed.
I would use another comparison here.
If a private person goes bankrupt, a chamberlain will come, sell his property, pay debts.
The state cannot go bankrupt in this way.
There is no chamberlain who will come to power and start paying his debts.
And secondly, what will the situation look like when the state goes bankrupt in the current situation?
This is probably one of the most important questions.
Can the state indefinitely borrow without a penalty?
There is no economic limit on how low you can fall, how deep you can borrow.
There is only one thing that defines it.
Sustainability of society.
As long as citizens sit quietly, the government will borrow the state, the government will get rich legally or illegally, always at the expense of citizens.
Let's look at African countries, Latin countries.
I think that's where the Polish economy is heading.
And this is no exaggeration.
Fortunately for us, Poles, we are incredibly entrepreneurs.
And only this allows us to exist as a European country and not immediately fall to the level of a typical banana republic.
The latest example we see is Sri Lanka.
It announced bankruptcy in 2022.
It has been going through a crisis for decades.
When its currency reserves were practically exhausted, they had a simple choice.
Either they will try to pay a percentage of the debt, because of course there was no way to pay the debt.
Or she will buy medicine and food.
Sri Lanka chose the worse, definitely worse, way.
According to Bloomberg, it was supposed to pay 8.6 billion dollars in debts and interest.
And its currency reserves fell to 1.9 billion dollars.
Suspended school activities, limited access to fuel, rationing, everything.
We also know it from the history of Poland.
What are the symptoms of bankruptcy?
Well, just exactly.
There is a lack of food, there is a lack of fuel, there is a lack of energy, there are problems with access to energy.
Let him see our last broadcast.
What were we talking about?
It was now in Poland.
And what did I say a moment ago?
This is one of the symptoms of state bankruptcy.
People stood in giant queues for coal.
In a country that is the largest coal potato in all of Europe.
Well, what are we talking about?
The same access to health care, we are talking about sometimes years of waiting for a treatment.
Food prices are going up.
We are talking about inflation, which reached almost 20%.
Poland could easily consider various options.
If the Poles looked at the complex summary of the Polish economy,
I suspect that only one thing would come to their minds.
That's why when you say ""Oh, it's worse in the US"", it's not worse.
Do you know what is the one fundamental difference between the US and Poland?
Well, we are definitely a completely different country when it comes to the level of democracy.
Yes, exactly.
And the point is that this is what is being talked about there and there are official Senate hearings.
And there is, I don't know, the impeachment of the president and the highest class of officials.
Special services are now on censorship.
CIA, FBI.
It is now being studied, it has been proven that people are being convicted.
That's the difference.
In Poland, how many cases have there been?
Let's take a look at the last 10-15 years.
You will come up with some terrifying number of crushing mega-scandals.
Who was convicted in these scandals?
Well, nobody.
And there were sexual and corrupt scandals.
Whatever you want, literally.
And that's with the highest people in the country involved in it.
Of course, none of them were convicted, none of them were even officially brought to court.
And in the US, such things are happening.
That's why, in my opinion, the United States is now doing a very big self-cleansing.
So really fundamental.
And I don't worry about their economy at all, as long as they go through this self-cleansing process.
I don't see such mechanisms in our country.
We have not convicted any high-class official.
And that's what worries me. Not the numbers.
We don't have time for such summaries, but it's definitely a topic for a separate hearing.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you very much for today's conversation.

What's the news Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the news Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we are talking about America and this is not a very optimistic conversation.
I came across information from the United States.
In Los Angeles, shops are closing because there are so many attacks with weapons that the shop staff is afraid of their lives.
In New York, on the other side of America, 55,000 robberies occur annually.
What's going on in America?
It's even more interesting than it seems.
Because now he doesn't even attack shops, he just comes in and takes what he wants and no one bothers him.
Moreover, the official policy of most large networks is to fire employees who interfere with theft.
Well, it's absurd.
No, it's not absurd. As far as I understand, the mentality of America is present, the current ideology and the current regulations.
These employees are doing the right thing, who do nothing, right?
Yes. If you don't bother in any way, let's face it, people don't attack white people, but rather dark-skinned people.
And that's why the media can't talk about it, because it will be racism all of a sudden.
But the facts are brutal and no one is discussing it anymore, you just can't talk about it.
This is so-called racial profiling.
And so far it has been criticized and criticized, so in some cities, police officers just stopped arresting dark-skinned people.
Regardless of that, I don't know, they were walking behind a bloody machete, the police officer just turned around.
Well, because it would be suddenly that he is a racist.
The famous George Floyd, who was an actor in porn movies, a thief, a convicted criminal, beat women in pregnancy and suddenly he has a monument in the United States.
In my opinion, this was the highest point that the United States has found when it comes to this racial ideology,
where for them the glorification is what political, sexual or skin color views you have.
This has been number one so far. And the Americans tolerated it for literally decades.
But it's over.
Mr. Marysia, as you noticed, it is indeed difficult to find any information about what is happening inside America in Polish media.
However, on YouTube you can find recordings of Poles living in the United States or traveling around America.
And in their reports, the situation in the country is not happy.
For us it is important, because it is our main ally, actually a country that guarantees our safety.
What is happening with the economic power of America?
Indeed, the USA is in a bad state and this is literally in every aspect - social, moral, financial, and even military.
The USA is deprived of any real fighting force today, due to the absurd policy towards Ukraine and what the USA is doing now.
What, the whole weapon was sent to Ukraine?
No, they just don't have ammunition. They got rid of not only the ammunition they had, which they could sell, but even the one from their so-called ""iron reserves"" in case of a conflict.
This is not to be said, now it came out in the USA, that's why it's a small deal.
Because it suddenly turns out that if now a tiny state started a war with the USA, then the USA after a few days can throw apples.
The situation is so terrible, that replenishment of the reserves takes them 8 years, sir, to reach their reserves, which they had before the conflict in Ukraine.
They have no ammunition.
I saw comparisons, for example, of the war in the Bay of Britain, the famous war, the great war in the Bay of Britain.
You know that the number of missiles they used in the whole war in the Bay of Britain, is now practically used for a few days in Ukraine.
They would not be able to fight with such Saddam Hussein in any case now.
They would have nothing. Putin can lead this war for years.
And that's it. The USA just ran out of ammunition, even the iron reserves.
It just came out, they were hiding it.
It was like, ""Oh, that's how we send it, okay, everything is fine, but you have some endless bag with missiles, and it's super expensive and complicated.
We don't have anything like that, so where do you get it from?
Well, we take it out of our iron reserve in case of a conflict.
Very brave, not to say stupid.
Economy. We could devote dozens of auditions to the US economy, one by one,
laying out the first factors of how bad it is in the US.
But let's mention, for example, the real estate market, which is in a slump again, as it was in 2008.
Indicators are fatal. The whole market is practically in a similar situation as then.
The entire financial market, the US debt structure is fatal.
More money printing, which are useless.
Again, the biggest reason to worry for the Americans,
that is, the largest corporations that have been those ""other cows"" so far, bringing gigantic profits.
Now almost all of them are losing money.
We're talking about those mega corporations, like Disney, etc., which were the support of the economy,
they gave a lot of jobs. Notice what happened last year.
We're talking about tens of thousands of layoffs from the richest corporations.
Of course, I will surprise you, this trend is still there.
It's not talked about so loudly anymore, but unfortunately layoffs are still there.
And another thousands of people are going to the brink.
These are already terrifying numbers when it comes to the United States.
Because who's going to the brink?
Those best educated, from the best corporations, those white, middle class.
And who's coming for it?
We're talking about millions of illegal immigrants, who are literally sleeping on the streets,
burning fireplaces, breaking windows in shops, robbing shops, attacking normal working people.
And this is now the image of the US economy.
Not very beautiful, let's admit.
Mr. Mariusz, we'll take a break for a moment, too.
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we're talking about America and this is not a very optimistic conversation.
We were talking about the US economy.
What actually happened that the American car industry fell, which was a force?
That the problem is with heavy industry, even the aviation industry.
Actually, what else is left?
What is such a standard industry, the product of America?
Indeed, this is a quite complex and interesting topic you raised.
And to be honest, I will not explain in a few minutes why this happened.
I can only say that there is this growing belt of the United States,
that is, the whole belt of states that is characterized by the fact that they are empty, mega factories.
And that's it. They're just empty and rusty.
Now the US has moved from the industrial patent to the patent and logo patent.
This is much more beneficial for mega-rich and their businesses.
They have fewer problems and more money from this company.
Well, maybe one example. How many pairs of shoes does Nike produce annually?
Probably nothing.
A dozen. That's exactly how it is. You're right.
They have one, only tiny manufacture in the United States, which is mainly made of prototypes.
The whole production is done by completely separate entities,
which have nothing to do with Nike, but are just stickers of the logo.
And for that, they burn off a significant part of their income.
And that's it. This is what the business of the largest shoe company in the past looks like.
And this production is probably carried out outside the United States.
It's not about outside. It doesn't matter, because if Nike made these shoes outside, it wouldn't be so bad yet.
The point is that they do nothing at all.
They have no factory, no influence.
These are external contractors, literally contractors,
which you can have today, tomorrow you can not have, you can do it in Honduras, the day after tomorrow in Vietnam.
Because it doesn't matter.
They will simply send you a model, tell you what the requirements for the line should be.
If you meet them, you produce shoes for us. The cheaper, the better.
Whether small children do it, because that's exactly how it is.
All these super sports brands, for example, use child labor.
There was such a brilliant book ""No Logo"".
Only then it was very unpopular to talk about it.
Now no one even makes a problem out of it.
Everyone is laughing at it in stand-up, on mainstream television, it is said about it.
As if now the Americans have grown up to face the dirty truth about their business.
Once they produced.
Now they use other countries, poor countries, including permanent camps of slave labor.
These are all signs of the times.
When the USA was a power, now they have taken over the power in the USA.
Mega-rich.
And the mega-rich does not like to work hard, he likes to earn a lot.
He likes someone to work for him.
And this is how you have a new America.
Which is really just a spout of power, as we said.
Everything is falling apart and the question now is whether Phoenix will be made of this ash or will it be only ash?
Well, that's what the huge demographic change is all about when it comes to the United States.
It just kills white residents.
There are fewer and fewer.
I have also seen data that shows that the most voting group in the last elections were Latinos.
Does this mean that the era of the white man and the primacy of the white man in America is over?
You know what?
No, there is no such danger.
There is a lot of change in the United States, but the social structure is definitely changing, especially in some parts of the world.
You can see it in Poland too.
If you follow the election activity, you will see only one thing - decline, decline, decline.
And it's the same everywhere.
White people are not idiots.
They see that it doesn't matter how you vote, it will be the same.
It's not about the political party, it's about other media fairy tales, it's about economic facts.
In fact, there are always criminals in the background, there are special services and there are billionaires.
Please track any scandal, any scandal, any war.
You will see the same holy trinity that brings war, destruction and poverty.
Don't blame any politician for this, because a politician by definition cannot be someone who introduces change.
Because a person wants to have more money, more comfort, more power and less work.
You know what they will do.
This is the human nature, let's face it, it won't be any other way.
So no elections, no voting, no new party or new face.
It doesn't make any sense, it's just nonsense.
Change can only start from the bottom, because only these people produce some wealth.
And they work for these mega-rich people, they work for politicians.
Only they bring something to the social and economic life of the state.
More power for the middle class, for the working people, less power for politicians and for the unemployed.
This is the only political program that can make sense.
But you won't see such a program in any party.
Because they cut a branch where they sit.
A politician will say ""Ok, I will limit the rights of politicians and rich people who financed my campaign"".
People are cheated and some want to be cheated.
But fortunately I notice that more and more people say ""Wait a minute, I don't like it"".
I'm not supposed to be cheated, robbed.
And that's why it's worth talking about the economy, learning about the economy.
And stop talking about politics, because in my opinion it's just something that should distract us from important issues.
That's why all these ""WOAW"" etc.
This is a financial war, economic war, sir.
It's not ideological.
A very small part of people may believe in some ideology.
But most people want to live normally.
They want to raise children, they want to work, they want to enjoy life.
And that interests them.
Mr. Mariusz, a dot, but only for a moment.
We'll be back on the air in a moment.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial expert, president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"".
Today we'll be discussing what's going on in the United States.
You said that behind politics there's the economy.
We know that America is divided between Trump's supporters and President Biden.
In that case, what's the difference between the economic views of both leaders?
There's no difference, really.
People divide themselves on the Democrats and Republicans
only because some issues bother them more or less.
But in reality, it's a game of appearances.
More and more people on the left support Trump.
They hate him, really.
They think he's a clown. I do, too.
So why do people divide themselves like that?
Because there are things that hurt them more
and they're able to accept another candidate because they're less hurt.
The so-called lesser evil, which is, in my opinion, idiotic, but OK.
These people don't understand anything.
Practically most people, on both sides, want to live normally.
Have their own family, have their own job, build a house, go on vacation,
go fishing, drink beer.
Now, unfortunately, no more ""Bad Laida"".
We see famous leftist activists of the 60s
who are now the biggest right-wing advocates.
So, you see, as usual, it's about the economy.
States divide themselves and talk about a new secession war.
I wanted to ask you about that, if you don't mind.
America is a huge country.
Individual states have a lot of autonomy.
They can decide to a large extent about internal law on their own.
You can already see some divisions within the United States.
There are already talks about two types of states.
Some states have declared a state of war
because of the wave of illegal immigration.
Of course, we know that the Biden administration actively supports illegal immigration,
transporting illegal immigrants to cities and providing them with housing,
locating them in hotels.
A lot of criminals, dealers, bandits get to the states.
And we're talking about the US government, which is doing it openly.
Now, amazing things have started to happen.
There's an armed militia, organized by people,
which I've already mentioned,
which is literally waging a real war with the use of weapons.
Really. Again, we don't talk about it.
In the US, everyone knows about it, and everyone has a pretty strong stance.
Even leftists say, ""I'm afraid to go out in the big cities.
I'll never let my child out on the street because terrible things will happen.""
The police have stopped functioning in the US.
It's absurd that you can go out in the middle of the busiest street in New York,
block traffic for an hour,
break a window in the middle of the city, go to the store, take out what you want,
and not a single policeman will show up.
Mr. Mariusz, this America is currently leading the world's competition for leadership in the world with China.
In the light of what you're saying, the success of America is not so certain.
I wonder what the first symptoms of the change of the position of the world's leading country will be.
How will we be able to recognize that America is no longer the world's main country?
Only one thing. The dollar. That's all. Nothing more.
Until now, the dollar was and still is a currency.
All world contracts are counted in the dollar, right?
Yes, exactly. Transactions, foreign exchange rates, all countries are listed in dollars.
If a country does not have dollars, it does not exist economically in the world.
Do you remember our audit about the crisis? We talked about Sri Lanka.
How many people ran out of dollars? That's why they had to announce bankruptcy.
Over half of all dollars produced in the world are outside the United States.
If for some reason the states gave their dollars to America, America would experience total and inevitable economic collapse for decades.
They still have a gigantic excess of dollars on their domestic market,
but in case this second gigantic mountain of dollars fell on their heads, they would just be crushed.
All the wars I know, that were in my life, were about the domination of the dollar in the world.
After several wars that America has caused, attacking completely independent countries,
precisely because of the threat of the dollar, because some leaders wanted to break away from the dollar trade.
I'm talking about African countries.
The same goes for the war in Ukraine. It's not about Ukrainians. If anyone believes it, then keep reading fairy tales.
The point is that China, India, Russia, Brazil and North Korea want to create a new international object,
not based on the dollar, and the states don't like it very much.
They don't want equal competition, they don't want a free market economy, as it is often said.
They love monopolies. I have already explained this in many other auditions, this motive is overflowing.
Honest people want to work, dishonest people want to eat. You don't have to work at a monopoly,
because someone has to pay you anyway, the prices you dictate to them, because there is no way out.
People who are looking for a monopoly, are looking for it with all means, including war, provocations, murders.
And this is coming out on an incredible scale now, thanks to many achievements, for example, which are held in the US Congress.
Mr. Mariusz, there is still a lot to say, but unfortunately our time is up.
Thank you very much for today's conversation. Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman. See you later.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
The economist, the financier, the president of the Foundation of More Wisdom,
that is, Mariusz Stefaniak,
a lot has happened today during our holiday break,
after which we warmly welcome our listeners.
Good morning.
Among other things, the decision was made that in mid-September,
together with the elections, the Poles will participate in the referendum.
And as many as two of the four referendum questions concern emigration.
We have already touched on this topic in our hearing,
but it shows that for the authorities, the topic of emigration is also important.
In the 19th century, emigrants built America,
a country that is a model of development and success for many people.
Mr. Mariusz, maybe there is no reason to be afraid of emigration,
since emigration has such great potential.
I must admit that I missed our meetings,
especially seeing how many important things were happening at that time in the world of Poland and the world economy.
Of course, emigration was built by all civilizations of the world, as far as I know.
So it is a definitely positive phenomenon.
However, we live in probably the strangest moment in the history of the world,
because the known and the used words mean something completely different than they should.
If a foreign, culturally and lower in development nation
massively influences the dissent of its inhabitants,
it was called the invasion of barbarians, not emigration.
And they fought it, not financed it.
We should be afraid of this,
and the consequences, to be honest, can already be seen in economic statistics around the world.
But if someone is paid to come here, it means that the agreement you are talking about is there.
If there is no agreement, you do not give money for the arrival.
The fact that someone pays for it does not mean that it is in the interest of a given country or a given inhabitant.
Mr. Mariusz, you were talking about mass emigration, that it is dangerous.
We have examples of European countries, France, England, Germany,
which accepted emigration in the 70s and 60s already on a mass scale.
In England and France, they were often residents of former colonies.
In Germany, for example, a large minority of Turks.
How did these countries come to such an open, wide door to their country?
Good question.
The facts are that the economy of all the countries you mentioned
has been as low as ever since the end of the war.
It has never been so bad in England, France or Germany.
Why? Mass naturalization of these inhabitants, for example from Africa.
And now even in Paris, you have a district where the police do not know.
What is happening there on the streets also does not associate with France and Paris,
only with some dark streets, covered in Morocco.
White people, Europeans, are not able to do business there.
Because there is no such method to keep themselves when they are being harassed, robbed, attacked every day.
You will not get a pizza there, you will not get a car, because they are afraid.
If they have to go there, they come in a convoy of police officers.
These are the effects of accepting a large number of foreign cultures,
lower in development, in education, in the nation. These are the facts.
This is certainly very burdensome for society.
However, what impact does it have on the economy?
The German economy, for example, in the 70s, 80s, 90s, was a global potentate.
Yes, it was the largest economic locomotive in Europe.
Anyway, it has been said so so far, of course, it is definitely not true for many, many years.
The nail in the coffin was not the emigration, as you say, in those years.
Because it did not harm them. I mean, it did, but very little.
The nail in the coffin was what was happening there around 2010 and later.
I do not know if you remember this gigantic wave of media narration
about the famous engineers and doctors of Syria, Africa and so on.
How they are blowing up the German economy, that they have valuable hands for work,
they are super educated, they are running away from war, so they will work hard here.
And their millions.
Let's take a newspaper from the previous season, where the Germans were begging,
because it turned out that there was no one to collect ashes in Germany.
Where are they? Where are those millions?
The hand of work. And some even had two hands, those who came.
Only two left, sir.
But let's think logically.
And you have two options.
You will get money every month for free.
And if you will give birth to children, which for some may be a pleasure,
you will get more money.
Or you have to learn the language, culture, get up every morning.
And under the supervision of a raw German, it is very difficult and honest to work.
What do you choose?
I belong to a group of people who would try to somehow take up the work of life and existence.
I would not run away from it.
You see? That's why if you go to Germany, to Great Britain, you will learn one thing.
Oh, Poles, great employees, fantastic, let's hire.
Because that's what we are.
A normal, intelligent person can not not work.
That's why even those super rich people, finding some hobby,
so that he would not go crazy, sir.
But you have people who came from a completely different mental world,
from different values, and the most important thing that the media do not say at all.
Those who come, despise the country where they live.
They do not respect the culture, they do not respect the tradition, they do not respect the nation.
That's why they will destroy it.
That's why they will not love us.
They teach us their culture, sir.
Raping our women, imposing their customs.
And it's brutal, literally, without exaggeration, on the streets of big cities, European and American.
That's why we distinguish, sir, two fundamental realities.
When someone goes to culture to assimilate with it, he aspires to this culture.
A classic example, classical times, Greco-Roman.
They were the leader, and all the nations that came there, assimilated because they wanted to be Roman citizens.
Now, let's ask if Ukrainians want to cultivate our traditions.
They do not care at all, they want to speak Ukrainian.
And now all of Poland has Ukrainian inscriptions everywhere.
What economic benefits is it going to bring us?
When the Polish emigration went to Canada, America or Australia,
were there any announcements in Polish?
In them, really?
Or when the Moroccans came to France, were there any inscriptions in Moroccan?
Go to France, today, now.
And do you know what you will learn?
You are in my country, speak my language.
And if not, it's your problem.
The French have such an approach.
And they will say it brutally.
Mr. Mariusz, let's take a break and we'll be back to the subject in a moment.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
We are talking about emigration, or rather the difference between emigration and invasion.
We are coming back to our backyard, to the Polish affairs.
Polish authorities believe that emigration can be controlled.
That you can selectively issue permits for work and entry
only to those people who have been verified, are credible,
have education, skills and fit into our work market.
However, for unwanted guests, Polish authorities have prepared a wall on the border with Belarus.
And now the referendum question is going to the point that it is enough to make it impossible
for the European Union to impose any additional limits on Poland
migrants from European countries.
The fundamental question is whether it is possible to control emigration,
whether it is possible to control the influx of refugees or emigrants to the country.
Let's start with the fact that beliefs should be the domain of the Church, not the government.
An economist should know, not believe what is currently and what will be when he makes the next decision.
It is impossible to control the movement of larger masses of people.
The best example is the most powerful state in the world, the USA.
Officially, they have already admitted that they do not control it at all.
It came to the point that people started to protect the borders of the country on their own.
They created the so-called militia.
Anyway, it has been like that for centuries.
This is one of the most effective methods, that is, people simply defend themselves.
And only they have a really positive impact when it comes to securing the borders.
The American Great Wall for a billion dollars does not work.
The Polish wall on the border with Belarus does not work at all.
It does not make any sense at all.
This is definitely a bad direction of approach.
That's all I can say.
Mr. Marysia, let's talk a moment about what the organization of such emigration looks like.
Because it is a huge industry, in fact, international, giving great profits.
It is well known that the transfer of an emigrant from the Middle East to Europe costs such a person several thousand euros or several thousand dollars.
Regardless of whether he is driving, let's say, cars, trucks through the European part or sailing through the Mediterranean.
Who to actually afford such an expense?
We are talking about people living in countries where they earn minimal money.
The Italian mafia stopped dealing with practically all crimes, and it was dealing with the transfer of these poor refugees from Africa, Syria, etc.
They just took care of it.
Because they give the most money.
Well, like some poor man from Africa, where they earn 50 cents a day, to pay him 5,000 dollars.
It's just absurd, impossible.
There are people, there are entities, there are whole organizations that finance the entire transfer networks, cooperating with the mafias, sir.
And these are things documented, proven, as if it is beyond any discussion.
I even saw, I will tell you, flyers that are distributed in these countries.
With the instruction, you will go to Europe and everything is written.
What will be, what you have to do, what you have to say, and then suddenly it turns out that in Sweden, the bearded Arab is an underage Syrian immigrant.
So he says, ""And I have five more things, four wives, etc."" and suddenly brings in 30 people.
He was the only illegal underage immigrant.
Women and children, sir, who always come.
Women and children always come, sir.
Like those Ukrainians who drove in women and children.
And those great Ukrainian bulls that walk on Polish streets, I don't know where they come from.
It's like that everywhere, sir.
Because we will help women and children. And it's so noble.
But why can't we help these women and children on the spot?
In Ukraine, Syria, Africa, in their country, in their language, in their culture.
Why do they have to travel half the world to get here?
What's the point?
The mafia is making money on it, or we finance the mafia, sir.
How much is the deal in Poland, let's take any newspaper.
They intercepted another transport with different nations.
Illegally smuggled through Polish borders.
We're talking about billions of dollars pumped into the criminal world.
Because they're not some nice, honest people, when a neighbor will transport someone by boat to save him, because he would die somewhere in his country.
It doesn't happen, sir.
Mr. Mariusz, but in Poland, when it comes to stopping a bus with illegal immigrants, the driver goes to prison, and the illegal immigrants are sent to the country from which they came, most often to Slovakia.
We punish those responsible for organizing this.
Why do you say we finance this activity?
What punishment? What are you talking about?
How much did someone get? What sentence?
Do you sit in prison? Because they usually don't sit in prison, sir.
Because it's not such a huge crime to get 10 years in prison.
So they get a sentence in prison, and we're talking about money, we're talking about millions, millions, millions that these people earn.
For them, that one guy will go to prison for a few months, it's just a joke.
Especially, look at the effectiveness of catching these people.
Because they go to big catches, sir.
For the border guards, for the police, like, you can name any criminal group operating in Poland that didn't have any police services.
These people earn huge millions, and the policeman earns a few thousand zlotys, then suddenly everything becomes obvious.
We have to pay for it, sir.
Who pays for these subsidies? Who even pays for the prison where this guy will go?
You keep him.
If this immigrant finally lands here on subsidies, or you get robbed, or even something gets caught, you'll pay for it anyway.
In any case, you are a payer here.
Mr. Marysia, please, a moment of break, we'll be back in a moment.

What's the deal, Mr. Marysia?
The financial analyst, the president of the Foundation for More Wisdom, Mariusz Stefaniak, is talking about emigration today.
Among other things, about emigration that Poland is dealing with.
In the first days of the war in Ukraine, which began in February last year, Poland opened the border in an uncontrolled way
and allowed all the refugees to enter, everyone who wanted to enter Poland.
These people were treated as refugees from under the bombs, who needed help due to humanitarian, Christian reasons.
18 months have passed, Ukraine has officially undergone a counterattack.
Meanwhile, about 25,000 people from Ukraine still come and go to Poland every day.
Are we dealing with refugees or are we already dealing with economic emigrants?
First of all, I always approach all the data provided by the officials with great impudence.
Let me explain to them how technically it is possible for an official to be able to state that of the 15 million that have flown to Poland, 13 have returned to their country.
Because I know data from other countries, even from Germany, a larger number of them remained.
Moreover, those who entered the European Union through the Polish border can simply move around freely.
They have traveled to all the countries.
There is no control over whether the one who went to Spain or Germany is not in Poland now.
We only know that there are about a million to a million and a half of those who are identified, have PESELs and so on.
But we don't know where they are.
We have no control over it.
We don't even have a clue about the scale of the phenomenon, because we are talking about millions here, who are moving from one country to another.
Moreover, Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
The best example, recently President Zelenski recalled all 33 heads of the election commissions in Ukraine due to scandalous, even according to Ukrainian standards of corruption, it really says a lot.
It turned out that practically only the disabled and the disabled were taken to the army, because the one who had the minimum of reason, money and regulations was released from the army and was granted permission to leave for Poland, for example, to the European Union.
According to official regulations, he had no right to leave at all.
And when you saw on the borders the masses of hundreds of thousands of young Ukrainians, why did our border guard let them in at all? This is a mess for me.
Since there is a decree of the President of Ukraine on poverty, we accept and support the deserters.
There is no other word for it. These are deserters.
And to this, criminals, because by breaking the law, the catch, that is, crimes, got to Poland.
Not only that, let's take into account that there is something like trade in documents in Ukraine, trade in residence cards, mass smuggling of documents.
So the same Ukrainian could leave Poland 15 times under a different name.
We are talking about criminal groups that do it.
Let us remind you for fun that these millions of Ukrainians entered during lockdowns, where Poles had a duty to wear masks, a minimum distance of 1.5 meters, plexiglass in each cash register, etc.
You could not meet your family for Christmas if there were more than 5 people.
You could not go to the graves because there was a ban on entering the cemeteries for all holidays.
And at this exact time, several million Ukrainians enter.
Without vaccines, without masks, without distances.
I have not heard any scientific explanation of how we all did not die.
Therefore, if you look at the facts, sir, and on the one hand at the government's narration, the government's narration, on the other hand, it starts to spread in a scandalous way.
I am also not able to verify this, but in my life experience I have met Ukrainians working in Polish shops, speaking Polish, learning for me.
This is an example of positive emigration that wants to integrate.
You learn the language of those people you also mentioned, who are an added value, that they are a positive part.
This shows that this emigration, this invasion, also takes place on the part of Ukraine. Why should we be afraid of this excessive influx of Ukrainians?
Do you think that Ukraine is a better employee than Poland?
I would make a decision knowing the person and her qualifications and competencies.
Due to nationality, I would not make such a decision.
Ok, I will give you a simple fact. According to the available estimates, about 21 million Poles live abroad.
We are one of the largest enclaves in the world.
Wherever you go and ask about a Pole, they will say, ""Yes, Poles, employees, competent, trustworthy.""
Why do 20 million Poles live abroad?
The alternative, I understand, of governments is to expel Poles from abroad, so that they can be there, in their homeland, work, so that they can enrich their economy, their culture, their traditions in other countries.
Because Poles bring all of this with them.
We have a very rich culture, a very rich tradition.
We are very hardworking and intelligent.
We are very helpful as a nation.
We have expelled tens of millions of Poles from the country, and instead we have an alternative, let's bring Ukrainians.
Ok, so please tell me what cultural values ​​Ukrainians will bring us instead of Polish cultural values.
What better will they bring us?
And someone tells me that this is good for the economy?
We get rid of the best employees in the world, i.e. Poles.
And we bring ourselves worse substitutes.
We bring our subordinates, who are cheated, they will come to us and live on the streets, or they will be doing gangs.
Check the police statistics, Ukrainians dominate them.
This is how it ends, sir, if something is replaced, which is culturally compatible with values, and as I say, at the highest level when it comes to workability.
Ukrainians will not assimilate with Poland, because they do not respect Polish culture, they do not admire Polish culture.
They even destroy Polish culture.
Let him check how the Polish enclave was and is treated in Ukraine.
Nobody is interested in Polish culture in Ukraine except Poles.
And even government-to-government they were persecuted, destroyed.
They want to speak Ukrainian, they want to have their portraits of Banderas, who for them is a national hero, sir.
Anyway, recently our ministry asked to apologize for the slander, the answer was simple - we do not intend to.
In Lviv, in 2002, it was announced ""Rock Bandera"".
Mr. Mariusz, our time is running out, although the discussion is very interesting. I think that we will do a separate hearing on the subject of how to get the Poles who left our country back.
Thank you very much for the interview, Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier. The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman. See you.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz? Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
We're talking about apartments in Japan, but not only in Japan.
I was wandering around the Internet and found a blog of a Pole who lives in Japan and who talks about the living conditions of a country that is a world economic power.
Most Japanese people don't have their own home.
They rent apartments all their lives because they just can't afford to buy one.
For a 20-meter-high tile, you had to pay a balance of about PLN 2,000 in rent in Tokyo two years ago.
A two-times-larger apartment, 40 meters is the norm for a family, is two times or more expensive.
Only people with a stable job and good income can afford such a rent.
Meanwhile, in Poland, two-thirds of the population lives in their own home or apartment.
Does this mean, Mr. Mariusz, that the Japanese should envy us and build a second Poland?
Of course not. I'd rather say that most of them wouldn't fit in here.
Because, as far as I know, at least 60% of Japanese people have their own apartments.
But we're right that the number of apartments that Poles have is absolutely true.
But economically, let's face it, it's a completely different world.
Japan was and still is one of the most powerful economies in the world.
As for the cost of living in Japan, it's not as if you could think that apartments are more expensive, it's not.
There's a big dichotomy in Japan, a sound gap between Tokyo and the dozens of largest cities in Japan.
In fact, owning a new apartment in Tokyo is a task for a billionaire.
A millionaire is not able to get such apartments, it's practically beyond his reach.
This is absurd, really.
But in the majority of Japan, apartments are very cheap.
Not only that, you can have an apartment for free.
In the province, I understand, right? You're talking about the province.
Yes, it's like in Sicily and many other places, you can have a whole house for 1 euro.
Why is that? There are a few elements, but I'll show you the main ones, the most important ones.
One is, of course, the effect of a gigantic demographic gap and, at the same time, a gigantic migration.
Young people are fleeing to Tokyo at any cost, for example.
And the rest of Japan is totally depopulated in such an absurd way that you have, for example, in large provinces,
a whole school agglomerate, where 20 children go to a gigantic building.
The whole school has that much.
There are only a few older people there.
That's all.
Really, in the Japanese province, you would be surprised how it works.
In a large part, it is very traditional, much more so than even a traditional Polish village.
This is a very interesting topic.
Except for Tokyo, except for a few places, a few nights at most, it is not like that at all.
It is not expensive, it is not crowded.
Even in such a Tokyo, you will rent a flat easier than in Warsaw.
Because the market works very well when it comes to rent.
Buying, as I said, is practically impossible.
But the flat? Yes, it is quite real.
People rent and they handle themselves quite well.
Mr. Marusz, but from the perspective of a simple man, what about people whose country is a economic power,
since they cannot afford a flat or live in very modest, barren conditions?
Japanese apartments are like a cage.
You can't even walk on the floor in your shoes.
Compared to that, we live comfortably, modernly.
So maybe, however, a country that is involved in housing policy in Poland,
and in fact, it has always been involved, in this case, has some positive effect.
You know what? First of all, walking without shoes is part of their heritage and lifestyle, not a necessity.
Equipment in a Japanese house is much better than in Poland.
More modern.
If you entered a Japanese toilet, you would not know what to do, first of all.
And even the richest Poles would have a problem and would be shocked at how high-level,
that there is an ordinary Japanese man who gets a salary from the company and is not important to anyone,
he is an ordinary, average office worker.
This is how it looks.
They just have a different culture and spread the money differently.
To make it clear, for balance, I will say that for Poles, for Europeans,
the quality of Japanese buildings is some kind of joke.
Because the walls are so thin that you will hear every neighbor, not just your neighbor,
but the neighbor's neighbor, with such details that you would not want to hear it.
However, this is due to the seismological curse of Japan and many other factors.
Exactly, Mr. Mariusz, let's finish with Japan, let's go to Poland, to our yard, but I suggest we do it after the break.

What is the score, Mr. Mariusz? Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation. We are talking about apartments in Japan, but not only in Japan.
Before we move on to the topic of supporting housing by the state, I would like to ask about one more thing.
In Poland, apartments have become very expensive, we have talked about this.
In addition, in the last two years, many more apartments have been given than in the previous period.
Meanwhile, Poles still want new apartments and are ready to pay for them.
They accept rising prices that set new records on the market.
Is there a price barrier for the price of an apartment in Poland?
Are Poles ready to pay any money for their own M?
As an engineer, I know that any number can literally increase infinitely.
The proof that there is no upper limit is the so-called hyperinflation.
Prices can rise absurdly without any control.
Ask your doctor, he will answer you quickly.
That sudden, uncontrolled, unlimited growth is called a ""new creature"".
So it is a phenomenon of a very severely ill housing market in Poland.
And because of this, of course, the sick Polish economy.
You were talking about a perfectly developed rental market in Tokyo, in big cities.
Renting an apartment there is not a special problem.
A large part of the population in Poland also rents apartments.
However, it is not as easy, as common and as popular as in Japan and probably as in many other developed Western countries.
Can renting an apartment in Poland be just as popular in a few years, in some time perspective?
And can it develop to the extent that car rentals in rental shops and airports have developed?
What is the price barrier of an apartment?
Currently, for an apartment in a large city, you have to pay even half of your income or more.
Is this a barrier to the development of the rental market?
I think we already have this phenomenon.
Renting apartments is as common as renting cars, for example, on vacation or as you say, at airports.
In addition, I would divide two phenomena of permanent accommodation with temporary accommodation,
for example, related to science or work.
Because in Poland there was a new phenomenon that never existed.
People live somewhere else, and live somewhere else.
A lot of people work, for example, in Warsaw, but in fact they live, have families, houses, at least in such a residential area.
Likewise, many still around, in the radius of, let's say, 150 kilometers, I'm shooting, from such gigantic agglomerations like Wrocław, Kraków, Poznań.
That people live permanently in another city, have houses, families there.
And then people rent apartments there, of course, not for a day or a week, so they rent it for a month.
From Monday to Friday they live, for example, in Warsaw, and then on the weekend they go down to their real home.
Some, of course, move permanently, move families and so on, of course.
But I still think that the majority is the group that arrives or lives there temporarily.
A classic example is, of course, the studio.
Poland is a very unusual country and I think it's a bad phenomenon, personally.
From what I remember, I think 85% of young people study or graduate from the studio.
This is a total absurd for me, because of course we are aware that most of these studios are some kind of a joke, not a studio.
Our economy, the economy pays for it, for these useless titles, pieces of paper that are useless.
That's why, you see, there are many factors that make it the way it is.
And I would not be happy at all that people rent so widely if it were not for the reasons I just mentioned.
These are very bad reasons, because it shows that the economy is unbalanced,
that people, doing absurd things, are trying to save themselves.
For example, in Lublin, all the cities that used to be under the Tentatami, had a lot of very strong factories, large factories.
Now they have literally nothing. They have only blocks and they have gigantic residential estates, sir.
We buy it from people who work in other places, because they can afford it.
So he went from Radom to Warsaw, earned money and bought a flat in a block in Radom.
What is the point of this, sir, economically?
Well, Mr. Mariusz, but maybe this is a natural phenomenon in the world economy.
You mentioned Japan, for example, a moment ago. Ten large agglomerations and basically a growing desert,
where there are no people, where there are no people, where real estate is for a zloty or for free.
Maybe we are facing the same perspective.
Well, yes, but let's pay attention to the fact that the assessment of this phenomenon is unambiguous.
And everyone, even the governments, assess it as a clearly negative phenomenon.
All the analysis, all the reports, all the official positions say one thing - this is a tragedy.
And now the question is, the Japanese government is also wondering what to do.
It's more or less like 500+, which was supposed to wonderfully increase the population.
And as you probably already know, it had no impact at all.
Besides, we lost billions of zlotys to finance alcoholics, menelis, child laborers, etc.
The Japanese do similar brilliant things, the Japanese government.
The Chinese have exactly the same problem, sir.
One of the most populous countries in the world has exactly the same problem, sir, as the populous Japan, or now dying, physically dying Poland.
You know that there are fewer Poles a year, simply because we are dying.
We are getting populous.
That's the problem.
That's why, sir, there will be empty states, and we're talking about many thousands of empty apartments.
In China it's even funnier.
There are whole empty cities, whole gigantic mega-dwellings, sir.
As we said, Poles have a lot of apartments.
More than the rich Japan, which is interesting.
We are talking about apartments owned, of course, by private owners.
And this is not a good phenomenon, really.
Because if all these grandmothers die, why would a child working in Warsaw, living in Warsaw, be in a happy, low-income apartment?
It's nothing.
Just like in Japan.
Suddenly there will be tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of such apartments on the market and no one will want them.
We will be giving these apartments for 1 zloty, as I say, in Sicily, or in Japan, or in many other places in the world.
Is it cool?
It's destructive for the economy.
This policy, which says ""let's make a mega-city that will rule the whole country"" is a utopia.
You know, this is the idea of ​​science fiction movies.
It can't work. It doesn't work.
If a country does not develop evenly, there is no strong basis, it means that something is deeply wrong there.
I invite you for a moment of break.
We still have the third part ahead.

Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier.
Today we are talking in our hearing about apartments.
Apartments in Poland, but also in the context of what is happening all over the world.
I am returning to the issue of housing policy of the Polish government and other governments.
In common perception, the development of housing causes an economic growth.
Because people, for example, buy more items of housing and it turns the economy.
In order to warm up the housing market in the construction industry, the Polish government has been giving out bonuses for a long time.
Recently, cheap loans or common additions to apartments built by municipalities, communal apartments.
As a result, in such a mess in the Opole region, in the last investment, the price of building a so-called cheap apartment with government subsidies reached almost 11,000 PLN per square meter.
Who actually uses this support?
Are people who get such apartments later, rent them out, or are they really development companies or construction companies?
Interesting question.
To explain it to you, I will give an example.
I don't know if you like watching comedy.
I like it.
And a great comedy is one where the audience laughs.
But if someone adds artificial laughter to a bad comedy, it will not make the comedy suddenly start to be cool.
There is a laugh, but does it mean that the comedy was funny?
The same is with the housing construction industry in Poland.
The increase in prices and the increase in purchases does not give a real economic growth.
And what does it give? Inflation and poverty.
Because they have to pay much higher prices than they should normally.
Well, as you mentioned some Nysa and 11,000 per square meter, my first question is where the hell is Nysa?
How big is the industry there?
Maybe there is great tourism in Nysa, sir?
What's going on there that the prices are like that?
I would like to know.
Exactly, and I know.
There is no reason to go there.
Honestly, I would never go there normally.
Neither to some Nysa, nor to Opole, nor to any other nearby town.
Because why?
Because when I hear such prices, which again, I remember perfectly that 11,000 per square meter could be bought in the very center, in the capital of Poland, sir,
in the largest agglomeration, where the biggest businesses are made.
It really is this joke and it is one of those not funny, where artificial laughter is applied, because it is such a cement comedy.
Prices of real estate that are driven in an absolutely unnatural way,
that is, these prices do not result from normal economic development of Poland,
that we are rich, that we have a lot of investments.
Just like we said in Tokyo.
Then it makes sense that you laughed at these Japanese tiles.
Let's see what tiles were built in Warsaw.
How many meters did the apartment in Warsaw have for rent, sir?
The size of a locker for a toothbrush.
And what were the prices?
Like in Tokyo.
I would like to ask you about such a thing.
As you know, regulations can stimulate certain economic phenomena, for example, encourage building apartments for rent.
How do you assess Polish regulations?
Do they protect the property well, for example, the apartment from tenants, because it is known that you can find various tenants?
Do the regulations allow for simply renting out free apartments?
Great question.
Polish regulations are fatal for the owners of apartments.
People usually know perfectly well whether they have to build, sell or rent and no one has to explain it to them,
but this is exactly the evolutionary ability of survival, shaped over many thousands of years.
People who have the money, the opportunity, the knowledge to build large amounts of apartments,
they build these apartments on a whim, because it is a mega business for them.
Poles do not build apartments on a whim, because it is difficult and expensive.
There is one last thing I wanted to ask you about today in the apartment hearing.
One of the methods of encouraging or encouraging the construction of single-family apartments is to loosen the regulations related to issuing permits.
Until recently, you could build a building with a residential area of up to 70 square meters without a permit for self-reporting.
There are no longer any surface limits here.
How do you assess these changes? On the one hand, is there any risk of building quality deterioration?
Will we have ugly architecture around us, buildings that are even endangering our lives?
Will it not be dangerous?
What are these changes for? Who do they serve?
I assure you that they will not serve most Poles,
because they cannot afford to build them at these prices, and they do not even need apartments.
According to the latest analysis of the Polish housing situation, 3 out of 100 Poles assess their housing situation as ""bad"",
and only 26 as ""average"".
We really don't need it.
Why do we ask ourselves this question?
Who are these regulations for?
It doesn't matter if you build a small house somewhere and it will be nicer or worse than the architectural requirements.
It really doesn't matter.
But if you build entire housing estates, it already has a gigantic significance.
Who can afford to build such housing estates?
Who has the ability, the money to do something like that?
It's not a Pole. He doesn't have the money, he doesn't even want it.
Most Poles who buy apartments now do it for speculative purposes.
If the apartments were cheap, I would buy it by borrowing money,
I would pay the loan through the rent, and in this way, in short, I would get the apartment for free in 10, 20, 30 years.
This shows how bad the housing economy is in Poland, how badly these governments have been operating for decades.
The political option doesn't really matter here.
All governments have the same fault, that is, they completely destroy the Polish economy,
and at the same time they enrich the minimum number of people and objects behind them.
And not only that, all of this is just the tip of the iceberg, sir.
The real problem is that it would look like the governments hate the situation where Poles own their own property,
they are financially and housing-wise independent from the government,
and all the regulations over the last few years have only one goal - to discourage Poles from owning apartments,
to make it impossible for them to own apartments, or to push them into a situation where they will borrow money and make a huge effort to buy these apartments,
and then these apartments will be taken away from them.
Please quote me in a few years with what I will say now.
I predict that in a few years, Poles will be massively deprived of real estate,
and savings are already deprived, and on a gigantic scale.
I would be wrong, to put it briefly. I really wouldn't want to be right here.
With this sad thread and this statement, I think we will have to end today's broadcast, because our time is up.
Thank you very much for the interview, Mariusz Stefaniak, economic and financial expert, and the program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.
See you next time.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
This time I didn't hear anything, but I had the opportunity to experience it with my own eyes.
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Today's topic of our conversation is energy, the topic is self-play,
very relevant always, Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
Probably, like many Poles, I recently got a payment for energy, an annual payment.
Please imagine that for this year I paid my bills well,
I was walking around the house, I turned off unnecessary bulbs,
and in the meantime, in the end, it turned out that I have a very large addition to regulate.
And again I asked myself a question, which, by the way, has already been asked in the frames of our audition.
Why is energy so expensive?
Since the outbreak of the war with Ukraine, a year and a half has passed
and the markets should have calmed down,
and maybe they even calmed down, because some prices of energy carriers have fallen.
What's going on?
Because no meaningful or independent economic factors affect prices,
only politicians and business systems.
Legal or not, that's a different topic.
That's why I can document that prices in the world's exchanges
and how the global system of their production works
is actually one big price conspiracy.
I swear it's not even the slightest exaggeration.
Mr. Mariusz, but we see on our market, someone who burns coal,
this year he will buy this coal twice as cheap as the year before.
It's a fact.
70% of Polish energy is produced from coal.
Well, it should somehow translate into a drop in prices.
The fact that coal prices are behaving like a yo-yo
is personally funny and terrifying to me.
How can this be?
The fact that prices for citizens have no connection
with the prices of the world's exchanges or the rules of the economy
is simply absurd.
All the most important prices are currently motivated
politically, not economically.
The rulers look at how much they can afford
to take money out of the pockets of citizens and taxpayers
to satisfy the rich who finance these politicians.
Whether it's through official money, like political campaigns,
or just small- or large-scale schemes
with mega-rich people who have an evident interest
in building huge monopolies,
to launch such price jumps.
Because remember, ladies and gentlemen, that in the economy
you gain the most not when there is a stable economic situation
on a market, but generally you earn the most
when there are gigantic drops and increases.
And those who know about it, or even prepare it,
have a recipe for success.
You can't lose on it when you know that a tax will come in
and you'll use it before it comes in.
That's how the biggest fortunes of these super-rich people were created.
It's all the same stories,
that these were government contracts,
that they were getting a monopoly on something.
So I'm just waiting for some scandal to come,
where it will be said clearly that it was all a scam.
I have no other word for something like that.
Mr. Mariusz, I'm going back to the question and the thread you raised.
Today, the energy payments made by the residents
are 40 or 60 groszy per kilowatt.
Forecasts say it will reach the zloty,
so we are waiting for more increases.
The payments that have now somehow eased the effects of these increases will be liquidated.
Inflation is coming, which is hitting us in the pocket.
What is the acceptable level, which you mentioned,
how much can politicians afford to raise the energy price?
How much we will allow them?
The answer is only one.
We decide whether we want to be robbed or not.
As I said, there are no independent,
economically conditioned factors
that would cause coal to jump 100, 200, 300 percent
and then drop by 50 percent.
Mining is a super stable thing.
You can't suddenly accelerate and slow down.
The same goes for the power plant.
You can't just stop it for an hour and then do it.
It is impossible.
It is technically impossible, ladies and gentlemen.
These are very long-term actions.
You can't suddenly increase, decrease, cut something here.
It doesn't work like that.
All you see is the effect of something
that is a monopoly or an oligopoly.
A situation where either one or a few big ones
rule everything, completely, totally everything.
Then customers have no influence
on what is happening on the market.
Therefore, the only solution is to liquidate
these monopolies and oligopolies
because it is too dangerous.
A greedy, greedy politician uses it to make money
and thus, of course, to give gigantic profits
to these oligarchs, fuel, economic,
arms, pharmaceutical.
As if we see it all with our own eyes.
We pay for it.
There is only one thing behind it.
The contact between politics and business.
It is not public, it is not legal.
It is obvious that these are not healthy, normal systems.
As long as we allow it, it will be like that.
Politicians only look when people are
sufficiently angry, as it was with these masks.
People had enough and suddenly,
""Oh, we can tolerate it from day to day.""
I am able to accept everything.
These masks, this nonsense, these distances,
these plexiglass everywhere.
But I am not able to accept that from day to day
when someone threw it away and suddenly
it became dangerous.
I can't accept that.
And that's what politicians should be accountable for.
This is evil for me.
These prices, fuel, coal, gas,
many more.
It's just a tragedy that we look at it
and say, ""Oh, well, actually, good.
Fuel has increased by 100%.
By what miracle? By what miracle?
How did it happen?""
Time for a break.

PARROT TV
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest, Mariusz Stefaniak,
economic and financial economist.
We are talking about energy and how
political conditions affect its price.
Many times in this broadcast
we have been talking about green energy,
renewable energy and regulations
regarding this energy.
During my holiday trip, I had the opportunity
to pass by the historically last
coal power plant in Portugal.
It was closed a year ago and since then
this country has neither nuclear power plants,
nor coal power plants.
60% of energy is produced
from the wind, from the sun.
Mr. Mariusz, why in Poland
this contributor is 20-20%
of energy produced
from renewable sources?
Why can't we go all the way
to production from renewable sources,
gradually limit coal
and, let's say, import
if we need more?
It would be a total collapse
of the Polish economy
if we implemented your program.
Renewable energy
in the form we know
is very unstable.
The wind blows or not much,
the sun shines or not,
summer is hot or cold,
water level is high or low.
You have no control
over it and moreover,
you don't have a forecast method
how it will be.
That's why it's impossible
to build any economy on it,
any factories, because it suddenly turns out
that you don't have the energy
to work the ship and the shipyard
because the sun is shining, the wind is not blowing.
What are you doing now?
Second, instability
of the transmission of electricity
and the parameters of this electricity
in the scale of the national
electric energy network.
Please remember
that the wires are not made of rubber.
They cannot be stretched,
extended, shortened,
increased, reduced. No!
So you must always have
maximum capacity and maximum
efficiency of all transmission devices
along the entire energy flow path
at the maximum
production of all
connected sources.
This is an incredible
logistical and technical
problem to overcome
with the so-called green
renewable energies.
You have to build a system
that is oversized
at least twice,
simply much more expensive,
let's face it, it usually leads to this,
which usually works
at 20-30,
at most 50% of the combined power.
The next factor
is the very
production of these
sources. It is incredibly
expensive, complicated
and destructive for the natural environment.
This is an important point.
The more we produce these
eco-sources, the more we destroy the environment.
This is the brutal truth.
To do it 100%
makes no sense.
There is no economic sense, no technological sense
and no ecological sense
even.
Another point.
We do not control the production of these devices.
We do not have
technology for this, we do not have a backup,
we do not have the elements that are
necessary for the production of these things.
100% we will depend
on foreign forces, foreign companies,
foreign powers.
Someone who tells such beautifully
ideological fairy tales is either
a total idiot or
he is a traitor
of the nation and
a sabotager on a gigantic scale.
But if we did it,
theoretically, completely understanding what,
we would run out of electricity?
We would assume that there will be hours
when we will have to turn off
electricity in our homes?
Yes, exactly as it is in many countries of the world.
And there are really many examples that
are based on such solutions.
You literally have zero stability.
Suddenly it may turn out that
you turn off one third of the economy
or factories
because you do not have the possibility of
powering them.
It is not about the fact that this energy will not be physically.
It is about the parameters of this energy.
It is on this principle that if one of the parameters
changes, all the parameters
really change.
It is not that someone will create
energy from the air, send it
and it will be great. It does not work like that.
Well, then I will ask about another
completely hypothetical solution.
We can change the energy supplier
recently, choose another one.
We can make a division.
If the supporters of
ecology, renewable sources
are ready to pay more,
then let them order energy
from the supplier who has
renewable sources
and let them pay more.
And these poor customers
order energy from coal and pay less.
Another fiction.
It sounds very nice and almost
reasonable.
So first of all,
there is currently no
technology known to me in the world
that could
choose
the types of energy.
We do not have such methods at all.
We do not have such a division.
It is completely, totally impossible.
Maybe someday. I do not claim that no.
The second illusion
here is that
we do not have
any freedom of choice
in prices or in the production of
this energy, because politicians
rule by prices and rules
of energy production and recovery,
not the economy or those who
produce it. It is complete
science fiction from the point of view
of real economic
or energy rules.
Here politics rules,
systems.
They decide
what are the energy prices in a given country,
in a given city, in a given time,
ladies and gentlemen.
The illusion is that you have any
choice. The illusion is that
we have this dirty and clean
energy and we can decide
where it will flow.
There is no such thing.
I will say even more. For every
kilowatt of this green energy
we must have a kilowatt
of this dirty energy guaranteed.
If we want
to have more of this clean energy,
we must have more of this dirty energy
to be stable. So if
for some reason this ""clean""
energy will not
enter the network, then we must
increase the production of this dirty
energy to balance
the need. Because people will
want to turn on their TVs,
recharge their phones or those famous
electric cars when,
for example, the sun is not shining.
And I will tell you that this is exactly
what is happening. So the biggest
consumption is when there is the
least production of eco-energy.
Let's take a deep breath
and take a break.
[music]
[music]
Good morning, Mr. Mariusz.
Today the topic of our conversation is energy.
The topic is self-play.
Very relevant always. Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the
""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation. Mr. Mariusz,
I would like to draw you into one more
illusion, fiction, perhaps.
In my town, before the war
and right after the war, there were
a dozen small water power plants
on a river that has a mountainous character and is
able to produce some electricity.
And that was enough to supply the city.
And today, local water energy
producers,
well, it's practically a margin.
Is it possible to return
to such local markets
with local specifics, with local sources
that will be autonomous
and stable? Yes, I think
it is possible and it is not a fiction,
sir, but in my opinion it is
the only way
to get out of this situation.
Monopoly,
catch-ups, these gigantic
energy companies
that rob us and more and more
shamelessly rob us.
But we would be able to provide ourselves with local
energy sources that would cover
growing demand? Yes,
no problem. And we even have all
the necessary technologies for this.
A simple solution? Geothermal.
At the level of municipalities,
counties - perfect.
Smaller ones are
small water power plants.
They should be crushingly super
promoted and common.
It is definitely super cool,
super interesting to create a lot
of small water power plants,
because they are cheap, efficient.
These are the only
really sensible ecological solutions
known to me in the world.
And the fact that it is not super
common is a total
crime for me. Mr. Mariusz,
but do you know the countries where such local markets
operate? There are a lot of countries
that have a lot of solutions
eco-friendly and also based
on water energy.
In practically no country
big it is not done,
but why? Because there is a big business
and monopoly. Imagine
that anyone will allow
or God forbid will launch it,
where there is an energy monopoly.
Who will allow it, sir?
What government, what corporations?
Because they will not earn anything.
People will earn on it. You will benefit from it.
That's why
no one is launching it.
That's why it's very hard to make such a power plant.
There are requirements, there are restrictions
and so on.
In my opinion, it should be very
super common, even promoted
by the state, because it is really
one of the best methods,
really, a real ecological
method of generating electricity.
Mr. Mariusz, but
for logic, since within a few years
we were able to go through a revolution
based on the fact that on every second Polish roof
there were energy panels,
so why are we not able to
make such a water revolution
in every town where there is a potential
to install a small power plant?
We are able,
but we will not do it. How many companies
actually produce photovoltaic panels?
A finger,
a hand would be enough for you
to cover the whole world.
Politicians like such businesses,
because thick envelopes literally
fall into their pockets.
Let's see
what the decrees are in the EU.
There is supposed to be a rapid increase
in photovoltaics,
and at the same time we see mega-catch-up
scams in the same EU.
Let's add two to two,
that these technologies are being launched,
which allow
to earn a small group of people
who control the whole world.
That's all it's about.
You can make a water power plant yourself
from scratch, without buying
anything in the store.
You are not able to do
anything with the photovoltaic system.
Unfortunately, you are not able to produce
parts for units, inverters.
You understand that
it is not the same as
launching a power plant, which is
well known, simple, safe.
There is nothing to explode.
Nothing bad will happen
if you have a minimum of reason.
With photovoltaic systems,
it is not like that at all.
It is more complex, complicated,
dangerous. An ordinary Jan Kowalski
will not be able to do it.
If he does, he will probably regret it.
Big companies do it, corporations do it
and it will probably stay that way
for years to come. That's why
it's a great business for these corporations
and for politicians,
who prepare legal foundations
for what is good and what is not good.
Exactly, Mr. Mariusz,
at the end I will ask you a question,
which I think opens the door to the next topic.
The International Energy Agency
predicts that in Europe
the production of coal will actually decrease
in the coming years, but in China,
India, Asia it will increase.
We will not have a global effect
and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
And besides, how are we supposed
to compete economically with
Asian countries, if our electricity
will be much more expensive?
Are we even able to compete?
You are right, you are right.
It is all literally
not making any economic sense.
Poland has such a small impact on the climate,
that it is not even possible
to measure it.
And China, being one of the
biggest polluters in the world,
is totally accepted.
It must be said clearly,
that the United States
have always been the biggest
polluter in the world
and these countries should be
imposed sanctions to notice
any effect.
The point is that these countries
set the rules and the government
will get a mandate for the coal furnace
in their home, which of course
has no complete meaning
and even all coal furnaces
from all over the world have no meaning.
Because one factory
sometimes produces more
pollution than the whole country.
In 2022
36% of the world's energy
was produced from coal
and that gave 8 million tons
of CO2 emissions.
So this is the beginning of this
whole lie, the eco.
In China in 2022
a permit was issued
or a preliminary permit
for the construction of 42%
more power of coal power plants
than in 2021.
40, so they almost double
the energy.
The value of permits for the construction of new
power plants in China
increased by 200,000
megawatts.
At the same time, the construction of
coal power plants in China increased
by almost 30%.
So we're still increasing
this consumption,
and we're not reducing it.
That's why, ladies and gentlemen,
any mandates,
penalties or restrictions
on private people
who have some kind of stove, chimney,
burn something there,
is a total absurdity
and a form of hypocrisy.
The world is moving
towards coal power plants.
It is rapidly increasing
the production of energy from coal power plants.
And no one is punishing them for it,
and everyone is doing business with them.
And no one sees any problem with it.
Whether in the United States,
which is the second largest
world poisoner, or in China,
number one, or Germany,
which is also one of the significant
poisoners.
This whole absurdity,
this econagon,
is being covered by
ants' mouths to reduce
the noise,
where the herd of elephants is standing next to it.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much for today's meeting.
The economist, the financier,
the president of the Foundation for More Wisdom,
Mariusz Stefaniak. The hearing was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.
See you later.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, economic economist, financial advisor, our weekly guest.
Today we are talking about miracles at the distributor and about other miracles.
I was shocked at the fuel distributor.
Anyway, probably not just me.
A few days ago, the price of a liter of gasoline, of diesel oil, dropped by about 40 cents, as far as I remember.
Does this have any economic justification, Mr. Mariusz?
What's going on in the world's oil exchanges?
Or maybe the government suddenly lowered the fuel prices?
Oil prices are going up.
Taxes and excise are the highest for many years.
And prices are falling.
Well, interesting, surprising.
Everyone is asking why.
Maybe we remember the situation during the pandemic,
when fuel was so cheap, because people didn't buy it,
because they didn't drive, there was no need.
Maybe we have a similar situation, that the demand has fallen.
The only logical reason, I think, is what is the main line
showing the basis of all economic decisions in the economy.
And not only in Poland.
Politics and ideology.
The elections are coming up,
so the price increases have not positively affected the voters.
Low prices?
Definitely.
Of course, we are talking about people who can only look at the length of their own nose,
and they have Alzheimer's and don't remember what happened yesterday.
So they are perfectly voters.
So we will lower the fuel prices for a few months, or anything else.
Coal, gas, apartments, we will give some preferential loans.
And they will forget that all the things I mentioned
have jumped up several times in recent years.
For me as an economist, it is literally a cheek, such a price jump.
And it has nothing to do with the economy.
It's pure politics.
Mr. Mariusz, I remember how fuel was getting more expensive.
One of the arguments from Orlen, who basically decides about fuel prices in Poland,
was that fuel in Poland cannot differ from the price level in Europe,
because we will have pathological situations, that it will be bought, exported.
It is just that we live in the border zone and we see crowds of Czechs coming to us to refuel.
From what the media shows, along the German border, the situation is the same.
There are even stations that have introduced a limit on the amount of fuel that can be refueled.
Only 100 liters.
Who can make supplies?
Can it somehow surprise our market?
No, I don't think it will surprise the market, because as I said,
according to my knowledge, this is a temporary situation,
so it doesn't really matter long-term.
But of course, first of all, these excuses were absurd,
that fuel in Poland must be as expensive as in Europe.
This is a total lie.
It doesn't matter.
There are methods to shorten any speculation, manipulation, etc.
We have to burden our citizens as high as the richest countries in Europe.
Idiotic idea, having nothing to do with the economy.
In no way.
So it was just an excuse.
KRL is a public company, it has the highest profits in history.
Because we paid the highest fuel prices.
Of course, these false excuses that they don't earn better on fuel,
but I remember in an interview I explained how it's done,
that formally it doesn't seem to make money on it,
but in fact, billions are made.
Here we have, on the other hand, an idiotic play,
from the point of view of the economist, of course, I say idiotic,
because for the government it is a brilliant play, of course.
When I look at the Germans or Czechs standing in the queues for fuel in Poland,
I swear I'm itching for teeth.
If our prices were set thoroughly, we would be happy.
Yes, it's great, we have profits, we sell more, we earn more.
Great.
But I don't think these prices should be set economically, in reality.
It's just another electoral sausage we've seen so many times,
and people with a maniac's stubbornness erase the memory
that every government does the same,
and then everything goes back to normal,
so again these increases, again the scandal, and so on.
It's funny.
As for the Czechs, I'll quote one of the publications I've read recently.
""The Czechs have probably the worst government in history.
There is not a single economist in the government.""
This is the pathology of so-called democracy for me,
that everyone is ruled by people who know nothing but talking,
that is, politics.
And suddenly it comes to such an absurdity,
that a great Czech economy,
because the Czechs really had a very nice economy,
a lot better than the Polish economy, to be more interesting,
but a much smaller country.
And suddenly it turns out that one absurd government is enough,
and the Czechs see it, they protest,
the society is really very upset,
they are right,
but I'm surprised that the Poles accept the government of people who know nothing.
Well, if you look at all these people in the highest positions one by one,
and tell me what they can do,
so really, what they have shown in their lives,
they did something, they created something,
in most cases, when I look at the lives of these people,
I want to laugh,
they are just some officials of political rank,
great-aunts or descendants of some officials or S.B. officers,
and these are the so-called resort children.
How are they supposed to rule well?
""Mr. Marysia, you do not appreciate the Polish government, evidently,
while the Czechs who come to us for shopping,
complain about their own, but praise us, because they have it cheap.
So maybe this is a sign that our government is ruling well.""
Great, you took it,
so maybe let's explain that the Polish government is good for the inhabitants of the Czech Republic.
It is one of the best governments for the Czechs,
which is a theoretically Polish government.
It is also the best government for the Ukrainians,
being a theoretically Polish government.
It is also the best government for the Germans,
being a Polish government.
And suddenly it turns out that our governments are brilliant for all the nations around,
except for the Poles.
I invite you to the break, we will be back in a moment.

What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Mr. Mariusz, our weekly guest,
today we are talking about miracles at the distributor,
and about other miracles.
The government has made one more surprise for the drivers,
and this information somehow passed, in my opinion, a bit unnoticed.
On January 1, E95 petrol, the most popular petrol,
fueled by drivers,
will be sold only with a 10% additive of biofuel.
Currently, such an additive is 5%.
The Deputy Minister of Agriculture explained that this is to improve the situation of Polish farmers,
who have a hard time, because they have to compete with Ukrainian grain,
so they will have an additional surplus on rapeseed, corn, bad grain.
My question is, does a higher fuel additive give anything to drivers,
because there are the most drivers in the country,
or, for example, it can mean lower fuel prices, because I have heard such comments before.
I definitely think that it will not lower the fuel price at all,
because lowering the quality
almost never results in lowering the price,
because that is not the purpose of these procedures.
The point is to increase profits.
Of course, the fairy tale about how we will support farmers
by lowering the quality of fuel,
we can do the same with cheese, milk, eggs.
Let's sell ¾ of an egg,
we will add half of the cheese to the sand.
These are just absurd for me.
I don't know if someone in common sense will really accept such arguments.
It doesn't make any sense, from any point of view.
If our farmers are not able to sustain themselves,
then something is wrong with agriculture, not with fuel.
Are we going to fix one industry by spoiling another?
Mr. Major, the argument is this.
Because there will be more biofuel in fuel,
so we won't have to buy so much rapeseed in world markets.
We will buy half a million tons of various types of grain,
convert it into alcohol, bioethanol, add it to fuel and sell it.
But why?
If we don't want to buy fuel,
then let's just stop driving cars to get fuel.
Okay, I understand that, I have no problem with that.
Only if we want to drive cars to get fuel,
then maybe we will secure fuel for these cars, that's all.
We have one of the largest fuel companies in Europe.
And we suddenly announce to the world,
that after we created such a gigantic company,
with the active help of the government,
suddenly, actually, we can't afford to buy fuel.
It all doesn't make any sense.
I say, this argument doesn't reach me at all,
to the smallest degree,
and it only shows the absurdity of the people who speak.
It really doesn't make sense, from the point of view of the economy.
But the defense of Polish agriculture,
Polish producers of grain,
is the main argument,
for which the government has introduced an embargo on grain from Ukraine.
We did it on our own,
because four months ago,
the European Commission introduced such an embargo,
but now it has not agreed to extend it.
We already have the first announcements of the Ukrainian government,
which, however, have been toned recently,
that there will be a response,
and that this response will be an embargo on import of Polish vegetables and fruits by Ukraine.
So what? We are preparing for a war of purpose.
Mr. Mariusz, who are the wars of purpose worth?
You know what? I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to the statements of politicians.
Because, finally, facts are the most important in life, not words.
The facts are that there are elections.
The facts are that the same government,
which is now so loudly announcing how it will defend Polish farmers,
has allowed for years,
or even actively,
has created an environment for destroying Polish agriculture,
among other things, this grain.
Do you know when the subject of Ukrainian grain came up?
When the protests of farmers began.
Where were the ministers at that time?
Where was the government?
And do you know who is behind this mass selling of grain to Poland, among others?
Ukrainian oligarchs, or the mafia.
And this was tolerated by the Polish government,
and the ministers of agriculture were blind,
and the Polish government was blind, and this time stopped.
Until the end, the farmers could not stand it, they began to rebel.
And then suddenly the government said, ""No, we are against it.""
When there is no way out, and the elections are still going on,
suddenly the first just government, the Polish government, begins to shout the loudest.
""We will defend agriculture.""
And where have you been all these years?
The good news is, Mr. Mariusz, that the government, however, is bending over before social protests.
This is a very bad news, sir.
Because it means that the government does not know what it is doing,
and secondly, that people are so pissed off that they protest against the government.
If the government were doing a sensible thing, it would not have a reason to bend over before anything,
because first, there would be no protests,
secondly, it would know what it is doing, and say, ""Listen, this is good for us, because here, here and here.""
And you will see the effects of our wise actions.
It is exactly the opposite.
The government is bending over because it was doing wrong.
It was harming our economy, harming Polish agriculture.
And people had had enough of it.
Mr. Mariusz, as a result of this grain crisis, we have a clear, at least media cooling of Polish-Ukrainian relations.
There are even announcements of withdrawing from various forms of financial support,
from which Ukrainian citizens living in Poland use.
What would be the economic consequences of this?
Absolutely none, because as I analyze it, it is only a media game for me.
You know that Polish people, fighting in the Second World War for England,
dying for England, had to pay around 108 million pounds.
We had to give back gold reserves, tons of gold that were stored in Canada, as far as I remember,
for letting us be murdered in the defense of Great Britain.
And now the second fact. Do you know how Ukrainian gold resources changed during the war?
Please guess three times.
I don't have a great possibility. They either increased or decreased, or they are the same.
You won, of course. The country destroyed by the war is getting richer.
The gold reserves in one of the latest data of the National Bank of Ukraine have increased to the highest level in history.
39 billion dollars. They are getting richer, we are getting poorer, sir.
Only they have wars, and we have peace, we have a developing economy.
So the longer Ukraine leads the war, the more gold they have, and in Poland it is getting worse.
And we are keeping millions of Ukrainians, because we ""help"" them.
You know, that there were revealed illegal connections and bribes, literally,
from Ukrainian oligarchs to the son of President Biden.
Those oligarchs are dealing with the trade of fuel, grain, land.
I remind you, the closest environment of President Zelenski was trading Putin's coal on a gigantic scale.
And we are such saints, and we cut off the evil Putin, his evil coal, because we will be saints from the Pope.
So they have no problem with this coal, with its trade.
They are pushing their grain into us, not of the highest quality, to make it clear, destroying our economy.
A simple quiz for you.
If the Ukrainians could afford to buy the son of the US President, they would not be able to afford to buy officials from Poland.
Please call with the answers to the phone that the editor will give at the end of the broadcast.
Mrs. Mariusz, break number two. We'll be back in a moment and we will finish our broadcast.
Thank you.
The end of the broadcast.
The end of the broadcast.
What's the news, Mrs. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial expert.
Today we are talking about various aspects of international, economic, political contacts with our closest neighbors.
Mrs. Mariusz, it is not a secret that we have to prepare for the fact that we will be competing with Ukraine.
Since the outbreak of the war, it has become more and more popular to say that Ukraine will sooner or later join the European Union,
that is, it will join the European Community, a common market, without customs, without any restrictions on the movement of people,
the flow of goods, services, etc.
Ukraine has much greater opportunities when it comes to agriculture, for example.
How have we used the last year and a half to prepare for the upcoming economic competition with Ukraine?
What is the basis of accepting a member of the Community?
Only the fulfillment of a long list of political, legal and economic claims.
Let us recall the facts.
Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe, ruled for years by oligarchs and various kinds of mafia.
I can't imagine any situation when such an entity would be in the near future
and be qualified to accept the same structures as France, Germany, Poland or Hungary.
Because the rule of law in Ukraine simply does not exist.
And such a country should be next to us and next to other European countries?
And use huge European funds for leveling levels, for support for various sectors.
Huge money would flow from the Union to Ukraine then.
Yes, but that is the problem.
Let's look at the gigantic scams.
In Poland, this is not discussed at all, but in the US, it is not a secret that billions of dollars are stolen.
There is no other word for it.
Stolen from the humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine.
Let us recall the whole basis of what we are talking about here.
The President of Ukraine was introduced to the media and politics, financed by the richest Ukrainian oligarch.
Ihor Kolmoyski, to be precise.
Who is the president of the United Jewish Community.
And he chose Ukrainian Jew, Zelenski, to be the highest official in the country.
I understand that he did it only out of concern for democracy in Ukraine, rule of law and the good of Ukrainian citizens.
But my question was directed in this direction.
How do we prepare for this?
Do we have any clear policy regarding the fact of launching the Union's membership of Ukraine in the European Union?
The only preparation from the economic point of view, that would make sense, is the exit from the European Union.
Because when Ukraine enters the Union, the exit is the only option.
There is no other.
If such an entity as Ukraine would enter the Union's structure, it would be the last fall of the Union on every possible field.
The Union is a solution, because it is absurd on many levels.
And it is bankrupt, physically bankrupt.
From the point of view of the economy, the Union is bankrupt.
There is no doubt about it.
The whole structure of the Union is degenerated.
But the entry of Ukraine would be the last nail in the coffin, in my opinion.
Mr. Mariusz, at the end, to relax the atmosphere, I would like to ask you about one more fresh event.
Namely, the recent decision of the Council of Finance, which lowered the interest rates.
Which, in turn, caused a sudden drop in the gold exchange rate.
The goal is to have cheaper loans in Poland.
Will it be good for the economy?
Or after the elections, because it is probably also an electoral step, it will be a blow to us?
I suspect that this is another electoral sausage.
Even if it wasn't, I admit that I don't focus on such news at all.
Because it makes sense to analyze only when the state economy is being run sensibly.
And not some crazy political-ideological nonsense.
And juggling the state's wealth and digging into the pockets of Poles, which I have been observing for years.
I quote literally all political options, not just one.
And the only government I can safely say that did not harm the Polish economy.
And even was able to help it, it was the Olszewski government.
It took some useful actions for Poles.
For example, it stopped the so-called privatization, i.e. the theft of various cliques of gigantic state property for free.
Let's add for the beginning that everything was leveled, all these wise arrangements by subsequent governments.
I would like to remind you that the overthrow of the Olszewski government took place in an extraordinary mode - at night.
I encourage each of you to watch the film ""Night Change"" before the elections.
And think deeply about your political sympathies.
Because in the end, only economic facts matter, not political slogans.
Thank you very much for our conversation, economist, financier Mariusz Stefaniak, our weekly guest.
And I will remind you of our phone number if anyone of you would like to call and answer the question in the quiz.
Or just give us your comments on our hearing.
Our phone number is 536-286-286.
You can record yourself all day. The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
Mr. Mariusz is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial advisor, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation and our weekly guest.
Today we are talking about the economic effects of the war on Russia.
I have been reading the last year's economic publications, articles right after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine,
which reported the effects of the economic sanctions imposed by the West on Russia.
Right after the sanctions were introduced, it was written that they would actually cause a rapid decline in the Russian economy.
Half a year later, the narrative changed a bit.
For example, CNN admitted last August that the sanctions had not worked.
But it hasn't worked yet.
But in fact, the economy in Russia is falling, only slowly and finally it will fall.
Today we are a year and a half after the outbreak of the war.
From what I checked in the economic data in Russia, this year the increase in the GDP was reported.
What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz? Why aren't the sanctions working?
You know what? There are two options.
Either it's a miracle, or the media is just telling us nonsense.
There are similar lies told to us everywhere, at the very beginning.
As soon as the Russian troops are destroyed, they run away, they surrender en masse, they have no equipment,
and we just wait for a quick victory of Ukraine.
It was a year ago.
I look at the front line and well...
It reminds me of what three things are the most important for the effective war.
Money, money and money. It's Napoleon, he said.
Exactly.
And today I would like to look at these three things, which are necessary for the war.
Let's start with a few facts.
Russia is the sixth power in the world and the fourth in Asia, in terms of purchasing power.
It is included, which is important, in developing economies.
2. The Russian economy has a great potential for growth, even if it has the largest resources of natural resources in the world.
3. Oil and natural gas in Russia are produced without so-called quotas, i.e. imposed by the OPEC.
It has such great consequences for the entire economy and for our lives that you don't even suspect it.
4. Russia is one of three, and recently it was the largest, oil producer in the world.
5. Russia is the largest exporter of heavy conventional weapons in the world.
And it is about 20% of all jobs in the industrial sector.
The war is not able to harm the Russian industry, because they live from it.
Mr. Mariusz, there are some indicators, for example, the Money.pl portal in mid-August this year,
which is quite recently, gave information that the Russian currency is weakening, that the Russian state's budget deficit is growing and inflation is growing.
These are some indicators showing that the economy is not good, it is not doing well.
Gazprom, according to the calculations I saw, has greatly reduced the level of profits it has achieved this year.
Isn't this a result of sanctions?
Would you like the state to have better indicators during the war than without war?
After 2014, half of the total foreign debt to the reserve currencies fell in Russia.
This only showed that the state became less dependent on foreign finance and on the international financial relations.
It is one of the last independent countries in Europe from the economic mafia,
which is above the governments, above the law.
They tell the governments what to do.
So Russia is currently independent and was and is one of the largest economic forces in the world.
In addition, 80% of exports are mineral and wood-based raw materials.
Russia has one of the smallest public debt indicators in the world.
This means that as one of the few, it can really afford it, it can manage.
It has smaller amounts, but it has ...
I had a comparison with a neighbor.
The neighbor has a nicer car, a nicer house, but everything on credit.
In a situation when it is bad, I don't know, both of you will lose your jobs.
Who will have it worse? Such simple questions for you.
Well, the loan will probably be due to the neighbor who has better looking things.
This is exactly Russia and the USA.
The USA is this rich, in quotation marks, neighbor, who is simply terribly indebted.
It's amazing how Russia is practically economically independent,
that is, it has the money it has and the money it spends, it really has.
Well, but maybe the reason for all this is that it was not possible at the very beginning,
from the very beginning, to effectively isolate Russia.
There is a whole group of countries that trade with Russia.
And maybe that's why these economic penalties don't work.
You know what, maybe let's say one word that will change everything.
BRICS.
What no one actually says, no one writes, and certainly does not show this in the right scale.
This is a new union, only such an international union and a union of real interests.
They founded it, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
Now it has joined a few new countries.
We are talking about the fact that these are the countries that are actually producing something.
And not only are they intermediaries, traders, speculators,
who pump their gigantic budgets through financial operations,
that is, operations on a computer, in short.
There is nothing there that would really stand behind it, behind this power.
Probably a new currency will be created soon, which you probably don't know yet,
but if you find out it will be too late.
Soon the dollar will cease to be, it is already ceasing to be the most important currency in the world.
Russia has prepared well for the war, ladies and gentlemen.
They have gigantic foreign exchange reserves.
Russia has 2,300 tons of gold, officially, I assume they have much more.
Let's add to this, ladies and gentlemen, the gigantic political and business influences in Africa.
Do you remember this Prygorzyn's death, his death recently and so on?
This is much, much more, much deeper.
Among other things, it is about gigantic amounts in Africa,
among other things, in various types of mines, refineries, where Prygorzyn, through his companies,
had several dozen percent of the shares giving him billion-dollar revenues.
Now, of course, people are taking over Putin and not only that,
they are rapidly expanding their influence on subsequent countries
and those in which they had shares and influence are still increasing them.
Africa is one of the richest continents when it comes to resources.
Russia is gaining, increasing its power, increasing its military strength.
Similarly, since the outbreak of the war, Russia's forces have not diminished, they have increased rapidly.
The amount of military equipment has not decreased, it has increased.
That's why I say, it's terrifying when I look at these media reports
and how many people are being fooled.
Mr. Matiusz, I invite you to a moment of break. We will continue our conversation in a moment.

What is being played, Mr. Matiusz?
Mr. Matiusz is Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist, a financial expert,
the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation and our weekly guest,
with whom we are talking today about the economic consequences of the war for Russia.
I would like to give a local example.
In my city, for 100 years, there has been a company, not a large one,
employing less than 100 people, but stable.
It produced valves, it was bought by a larger company,
which had several plants and one of the other plants exported to Russia.
After the war, it lost these markets, it qualified for closure.
It was easier for the company to liquidate the peripheral plant,
somewhere remote, to transfer its production to its plant.
The effect is that 100 people have nowhere to work.
Do you know any example of a Russian company that, due to economic sanctions,
which fell due to the war in Ukraine?
I know a lot of examples that have fallen.
For example, Lada.
Due to the fact that Russia does not produce many specialized, advanced sub-units,
mainly mechanical or electronic.
Anyway, China has a similar problem.
However, it is not Russia that is lost in all these sanctions and all this war,
but Europe and the USA.
Let us remind you that 46 out of 60 foreign producers in Russia have disappeared.
For example, Renault, a well-known company,
has recently invested over 2 billion euros and gave it for 1 ruble.
These are the times, and they say how weak the ruble is.
You see, you can buy a 2-billion-dollar investment with 1 ruble,
the whole modern factory.
However, the Chinese enter the market en masse.
There is a gap in Western companies.
As you say, a lot of companies in the EU countries are falling,
because they were gaining a significant amount in trade with Russia,
which was very profitable for us.
What is all this for?
Russian export is based on coal and coal.
The ban on export was to be introduced on coal.
Meanwhile, Western countries introduced something else.
The maximum price.
They pay up to 60 dollars for a barrel of coal from Russia.
It is even said to reduce this amount, to reduce Russian profits.
Is this a better solution than complete stoppage of trade?
Each of these solutions is idiotic in the economic sense.
EU citizens are currently paying high prices for fuel
in the name of some ideology,
when business is currently making record profits.
Fuel from this evil Putin is still flowing to us,
at least by the Czech Republic, the famous last affair.
Before we start to boast about the Czech Republic,
let us remind you that the Ukrainians themselves,
even from the closest Zeleny environment,
traded oil at Putin en masse,
just like the Ukrainian oligarchs.
So, without a doubt, others can also,
since the Ukrainians have no problem with it.
But I will quote something better.
The title of the Republic of Poland.
Ukrainian tanks are powered by Russian oil.
End of quote.
Russian and Belarusian oil products
have been in the forefront of Ukrainian fuel structures for years.
The total share is estimated at 70-80%,
that is, almost everyone travels to Russian Europe, to Ukraine.
We are here, holy from the Pope, sir.
We get rid of cheap and good fuel.
The Ukrainians have no problem with it.
We are making historical profits and add companies from the USA.
Because they have been experiencing the biggest slump for many years.
Now, do you remember how at the beginning I said
that Russia was once the largest producer?
Now it is the USA, sir.
Unfortunately, I'm not kidding.
Or maybe that's why we have this war.
Because a few items from the military fuel team
are getting gigantically richer.
Let's add American items.
One of the elements of the impact of economic sanctions
was the cutoff, or was to be the cutoff,
of Russia from the transfer of the highest technologies,
modern devices.
And it was supposed to bring this country back into development,
or even influence the reduction of their defense or military capabilities.
How do you assess the consequences of this kind of restrictions?
It reminds me of everything I've heard so far about this conflict.
We were told at the beginning that Russia was losing from the beginning.
Then we were told that the economy was breaking down.
And actually, as you said, let's wait a few months, it will fall soon.
Now I'm telling you the third story,
because of course the first two turned out to be completely, totally untrue.
But what's going on at this time, sir?
What do people forget about?
Hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into Ukraine.
Someone is making this money, sir.
Someone is getting this money.
Zelensky was in the USA and Canada,
where he was applauding the Ukrainian Nazis.
What happened there, everyone?
Zelensky said to the Americans, a simple message.
Give me 120 billion dollars
so that it doesn't get worse,
because he doesn't even promise that it will get better.
Just to keep the status quo, what it is.
How many more years will we put together these hundreds of billions of dollars,
so that Russia has what it has already taken so long ago.
What does it make sense?
Remember the magical word BRICS,
where we are talking about very serious countries,
like India, or huge ones like Brazil, or at least China.
They signed a very close economic and political cooperation with Russia.
And suddenly you want to say that we are taking all these countries under sanctions.
It didn't even work with stupid oil,
because it flows through Hungary, the Czech Republic, etc.
Of course, we don't buy it.
Let this oil flow, but we publicly condemn Putin and his bad oil.
But send us the guys, okay?
Mr. Mariusz, let me tell you one more thing.
How did these economic sanctions and war affect the average citizen,
the average Russian?
We saw pictures a year ago,
how well-known restaurants and networks,
McDonald's, Starbucks, withdrew from Moscow.
We know that they certainly can't buy an American hamburger
or drink the famous coffee.
But did their standard of living seriously decrease?
You know what, if I were to name two types of sanctions that really brutally affected Russia,
it would be the disappearance of McDonald's and the banning of several social media.
It seems that social media replaced their own.
Of course, yes, but I'm talking about the fact that it really affected Russians.
In fact, it only worked out for them.
And I'll be honest, I'm starting to see reports where it turns out that it has only good effects.
Because the pictures of Facebook or some other weird, controlled,
as it turns out after the US Congress,
by very strange individuals, in a very strange, unknown method,
for example, by ostentatious manipulation of reality,
through Twitter, Facebook, and a lot of other applications,
the American community was deliberately lied to.
The Americans are terribly pissed off by this, please believe me.
It really hurt them.
It was taken away from the Russians.
The punishment for Russia is that we will take this harmful tool from you,
which fools you, which manipulates you, which steals your data.
And you are exposed to various attacks by hackers, because that's how it ended.
We got rid of McDonald's?
Wow, what a punishment.
Well, they just crushed Russia.
Of course, the Russians got used to it, because it's convenient, fast, but let's face it, it's very unhealthy.
I'd like Poland to ban all these Western social media,
ban McDonald's, all this mass-produced food.
Russia will soon have one of the best food in the world.
What is supposed to punish Russia, really strengthens and rewards them.
Mr. Mariusz, the second break is ahead of us.
We'll get back to the topic.
Don't miss our next episode.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier.
Today we're talking about Russia,
a year and a half after the start of the full-scale war, so-called full-scale war in Ukraine.
Everyone expects that because of the economic collapse,
this country and its authorities will be more inclined to create a fast and unfavorable peace for themselves.
Well, if the sanctions don't work, if the economic situation in Russia doesn't get worse,
then the perspective of peace in Ukraine is also fading.
I would even say that it doesn't exist.
Currently, Russia has zero motivation to create any peace in any conditions of Ukraine,
except for the conditions that it dictates.
Actually, I would expect the collapse in the USA much faster than in Russia, as a result of this war.
The USA is incredibly in debt. Russia practically in general.
The USA has a vision of a dollar falling from the position of the leading currency,
and Russia has a vision of strengthening and exporting its currency, whatever it is, to the international arena.
The USA has a gigantic internal conflict.
I will honestly say that what is happening is the state of internal war.
I can practically see some American commentators who are talking about a new secession war.
One that is basically divided into left and right wing.
Not only that, the USA and the EU are facing the invasion of a million immigrants,
who are not going to work there, but for the sake of force, to attack and rob.
Let's put it all together and in my opinion we will see the collapse of the USA and the end of the EU faster.
I am not a big fan of Russia, I have never been to Russia, to no extent.
The facts are crushingly unambiguous.
I can only see two scenarios, ladies and gentlemen.
The collapse of the USA from the position of the leader on the world economic, political and military scene.
And the complete end of the EU, because in my opinion this will be unprotected.
Or the global war as the only method that can reverse this first danger.
We talked about the various effects of war and the economic situation, there is also the demographic effect.
We know that tens of thousands of young people are dying on the front.
In addition, hundreds of thousands of people are called to the army in Russia.
This must somehow reflect on their situation, because they will start to lack a job.
Will they not be forced to let the wave of emigration in to fill these missing places?
You know what? I do not know if they will be forced, but I know a few things for sure.
For example, that they have Chinese neighbors who completely accidentally close another gigantic western factories.
And maybe it can be done with one move.
As the English proverb says, such killing two birds with one stone.
Please note, Ukraine has no problem with the population.
So the occupation of Ukraine is one move to solve the Russian problems with the population.
And in general, the culture is close, the language is close.
Practically, the Russians always say that the Ukrainians are our brothers.
They have no problem with Ukraine, there is no hatred of the Ukrainians.
It may turn out that one of the effects of what is happening today,
there will be a union, union or even the takeover of Ukraine by Russia.
It seems possible.
I'm not saying it will be, because I have no idea from a military or political point of view.
But economically I see that it would be very beneficial and very logical.
To sum up our hearing, I will ask you the last question.
Why did the economy of the post-Soviet country turn out to be so resistant to foreign sanctions?
Is the key here not in the fact that for decades it was an absolutely controlled economy,
centrally tasked, isolated from the whole world?
I see two reasons.
One is that they prepared for it methodically for many years.
For example, on liquidating foreign debts, building reserves, we talked about the tons of gold.
It's just hard work for the Russians for many years.
Another thread, it is, as the only positive in communist ideology,
is that they wanted to be independent from the so-called capitalists.
Russians are logical, understanding and they say, ""OK, it makes sense, we are independent from the capitalists, so it's cool.""
If we were told that, we would immediately rebel, and probably sensibly,
""Why should we cut off from cool things, cool goods, cool programs, etc. etc.""
Why? No, absolutely not.
Russians have an ideological foundation, a very strong foundation,
that's why they are able to endure, as you said, those McDonald's, Starbucks, etc.
Of course, it's not cool for Russians, and Russians are not happy because of this war,
they certainly are not happy, but they are not unhappy, and that's the most important thing in all of this.
Russians do not suffer because of this war, not because it has no consequences,
but because they do not have this mechanism of suffering for this reason.
Because they understand that this is how it should be, and it's better for them,
even if I say it ideologically, most Russians live on a very basic level, a very simple level.
That's why most of all possible sanctions, the creation of firms, blockades, they are not able to touch them.
It can only be a small inconvenience for them, a smaller or greater inconvenience.
This is all that can be done to Russia, now.
Mr. Mariusz, we will see the future soon, maybe not in the long term, but everything is ahead of us.
Thank you very much for today's hearing.
The guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financier.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz? Mr. Mariusz is Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist, a financial expert, our expert and the president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"".
I was surprised, Mr. Mariusz, when I was reading the latest information from China and, to be honest,
I don't understand what's going on in China.
It's about the Evergrande company situation.
It's a global giant, it's huge, but it's in a big mess.
It's in danger of bankruptcy, it's in debt.
And suddenly, this company, after a long period of absence, returns to the Hong Kong stock exchange
and in one day its shares grow by 20%.
According to logic, if someone is in danger of bankruptcy, his shares should go.
I would like to get rid of such shares as soon as possible before they fall to zero.
Meanwhile, it was the other way around here.
What's the score?
Interesting question and very valid.
As you mentioned, it is the most debted developer company in the world
and one of the 500 largest companies in the world at the same time.
By logic, you are right.
Unfortunately, it should be remembered that China is a communist country
and everything there is only worth it with communist economic logic.
Construction in China accounts for almost one third of the Chinese GDP.
The Chinese government has found a way to level its internal debts
and at the same time withdraw money from the Chinese
in a brilliantly deceptive scheme of building unnecessary apartments
which, by the way, will never be used.
And at such absurdly high prices that the Chinese are in debt
because they can't afford to buy a new apartment.
I would like to remind you that in China, in order to have any big and profitable business
you must have knowledge of the authorities.
In China, the land belongs to the state and no one else.
It is actually impossible to buy land for your own.
You can not only rent it for 70 years,
something like our age-old country, but much worse.
Then the government will take this land from you
and sell it to another developer again, and so on.
Of course, let's add that developers know all about it perfectly
and build as badly and cheaply as possible.
It comes to the point that new blocks literally fall apart when they are given.
All elevations, ceilings, balconies, and walls can be broken with a finger,
not even being a Chinese Kung Fu master.
The government's profits from the purchases of developers' offices are really astronomical.
According to my well-known estimates,
so many unnecessary apartments were built in this whole scam scheme
that it would be enough for 3 billion people.
We are talking about additional apartments for 3 billion people.
And the whole of China has 1.4 billion, now more or less.
Two times such China would fit in what has already been built.
It sounds probably as brilliant as selling ice cream with Eskimos
and at high prices. And that's exactly how it is.
And of course, the whole scheme works to a certain extent.
Like any lie.
Who buys apartments that are in poor technical condition at the beginning,
in 70 years they will have to be demolished,
and there are too many of them, it should cause, with normal market mechanisms,
that these apartments will be very cheap.
Yes, you are right.
But it's not like that, because these are communist China, I remind you.
Why do people do it?
Because it is the smartest thing they can do.
Because in China you can't save money in any other way,
invest money, and part of Chinese culture is that
you have to have an apartment, especially if you want to marry a Chinese woman.
You understand that the whole mentality of Chinese culture is involved in this.
The Chinese speculated on apartments on a gigantic scale,
buying something they didn't need, for money they don't have,
in order to sell with a profit that is astronomical
and buy more apartments, it's exactly a financed pyramid.
A developer's financed pyramid.
Why in this case, all of this didn't fall, didn't collapse?
It wouldn't be avoided in any normal country.
The most important word in China, I don't know if you remember,
I once explained to you what is the most important word in China.
Please forgive my short memory, I forgot.
Face. Maintaining a face.
Both on a social, economic and political level.
It's such a big part of the economy, and the Chinese government can't say
""Yes, we are indeed fraudulent idiots, the whole economy is a joke,
and it all didn't make sense, that's why it's falling.""
No.
They have to have a method of getting out with a face, no matter what the facts are.
That's why you see what's happening,
and that's why the Chinese government holds everything very tightly
and can manipulate data as it wants.
To sum up, I will say that I may buy these shares myself,
if they are still reasonably cheap,
because even though the stock market price has fallen by 99% since July 2020,
the government may cause it to rise again in a moment, if it wants to.
Mr. Maryszu, but in a normal country, in a normal situation,
the stock exchanges have to publish information about their situation very carefully,
so that investors, shareholders, can decide whether to buy or sell.
Does it not work like that in China?
It doesn't work like that at all.
Evergrande, as I said, is the most debted development company in the world,
and in the last two years alone, it has lost around 80 billion dollars.
It doesn't matter, really.
The numbers don't matter, because another thing is really important.
It's a company that is, in fact, a part of the Chinese government.
You have to remember that.
As long as the Chinese government is in power,
these companies will also operate if the Chinese government decides so.
And no prices have any impact on that.
They can suddenly get any contracts, any financing,
anything can happen, because it's the Chinese government that controls it, not the economy.
Mr. Maryszu, please, a moment of break.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial officer, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about the international situation, about what is currently happening in Israel and Palestine.
Mr. Mariusz, there are such moments in history that even the economy goes down to the background.
I would like to offer you a conversation about what is happening in Israel and Palestine, about the drama that is happening there.
For decades, it has been one of the hottest places on earth.
Different interests meet, Jews, Arabs, full of dramas, human fates, whatever is happening now.
However, our knowledge of the region is often very superficial and refers to what we repeat, to such running slogans, to opinions that have been repeated many times.
One of such opinions is quite often repeated, the idea that Shin Bet, i.e. the Israeli internal intelligence,
and Mossad, i.e. foreign intelligence, are the best intelligence services in the world.
Meanwhile, these services, which we have seen recently, did not prevent the attack of thousands of terrorists,
fighters in Israel, the massacre of the civilian population.
Should the intelligence know about such an operation? Could it have prevented it?
I admit that I am not a specialist in military affairs, especially in interviews,
but I have found that military secrets are often more connected with the economy and finances than someone might think.
Here, I have also met analysts who believe that such a big oversight cannot be a coincidence.
This is perhaps an element of internal struggle, for example, for power, because Netanyahu does not enjoy the same esteem as most people think.
There are also concepts that the government, although it knew about the planned attacks,
it purposefully did not take any action to have a reason for the obvious destruction of something that has been a big problem for them for years.
Israel has been waging wars with its neighbors, with Arab countries, for 70 years,
and the Palestinian autonomy, which it finally agreed to, is not even a state.
Hamas is not an official army, it is actually a terrorist organization.
What political goals do they set for Hamas in taking such a very loud and very drastic attack,
which ended in a real massacre with many victims, on both sides, anyway.
And probably in the final balance, when this war is over, it will turn out that there will be more victims on the Palestinian side.
What do they need it for?
Let's note that Hamas is not just some ordinary combat units.
It is part of the larger forces of Islamic fighters called mujahideen, literally fighters.
I will not take a few minutes to explain to you the complexity of the ties, competition, conflicts between many Muslim forces.
I will just say that so far Hamas has received money from Israel itself,
and it was probably recognized by it as the only Palestinian organization.
And by its allies it was considered as a co-collaborator.
With this act, I understand that it cuts off from this, and thus it gets a chance to finance from rich sheikhs.
The Islamic world is also divided into poor and rich.
Only that they have such a unique method, it is called zakat,
and it is a practically a muslim co-ordination to give up the property of every Muslim.
In this way, the rich sheikhs pay the units of the suicide fighters to secure their luxurious life.
And on the occasion to calm the poor, by hiding from the overthrow of their governments.
It is a fairly complex system of economic ties and completely unintuitive for the West.
So what, Hamas just took care of money attacking Israel?
This is obvious. Do you remember our hearing where we talk about what is needed to wage war?
Money, money and money. Hamas is no exception here.
They also need money. Israel has long since stopped giving them because they have radicalized.
So this is quite obvious.
Mr. Mariusz, but the disproportion of forces is so great. Israel really has a perfect army.
It can summon 300,000 people in a country that has several million citizens.
They have perfect military technology.
In armed conflicts with Arab countries, it has always decided to make sharp moves,
to a determined attitude to defend its territory and its citizens.
How could it be expected that such an opponent could win with such a country?
They did not go to win. They went to die.
By sending thousands of fighters to conquer the whole country,
as it is written in their assumptions that every citizen is a soldier,
they predicted that those who were sent would die.
So they went to die.
Die and kill.
Yes, because this is the biggest possible gain for them.
You are probably aware of the assumptions of Islam and, among other things,
this aspect that if you die for the good of Islam, you get those famous girls and so on.
They are promised luxuries that they currently see in those rich sheikhs.
But they do not have the slightest chance of it.
Not only that, but practically all these fighters are extremely poor
and do not even have a chance for any decent life for themselves or their children.
That is why joining these fighters, these suicide attacks,
is the smartest thing they can do in life to improve the fate of their loved ones.
Most often after death.
This is a typical manipulation that we know in the economy, for example, financial pyramids.
Give me your money today, and someday you will get so much that you will not believe in your luck.
These sheikhs already have a mega profit today,
and the naive ones are waiting for the promised profits, which they never see anyway.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you for a break.
Thank you.
The end
The end
This is Mr. Mariusz, Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial advisor, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about the international situation, about what is currently happening in Israel and Palestine.
Mr. Mariusz, let's try to say something about the situation in the gas zone.
It is a very specific place on earth.
It is difficult to compare the situation in the gas zone to any other place.
Are we dealing with an independent state that is able to provide its citizens with basic things,
such as food, work, internal and external security?
This whole part of Palestine, which we are talking about, is actually just one city - Gaza.
It has existed for over 2,500 years.
Today it is destroyed, of course, and overcrowded.
But I assume that it will be demolished even more strongly and deprived of most people for the next few weeks in at least two ways.
Killing or expelling those who survive.
This is an absolute crime on many levels.
Once there lived about 150,000 people.
Today there are about 2 million.
All on a surface much smaller than the surface of Warsaw.
About 5 million people were expelled from Palestine in so-called ""night raids"".
We are talking about mass crimes, raids on the Palestinian population, carried out by synistric militias.
Poles should understand this perfectly, because they themselves have experienced a lot of such purges and forced resettlements
using exactly the same methods.
Currently, we have 2 million of these displaced people in the Gaza area.
As it is estimated, about 80% of them require immediate humanitarian assistance.
It reminds me of Warsaw during the uprising, where the Nazis, unable to fight the insurgents and humiliated by their military actions,
began to bomb the civilian buildings, literally turning our capital into rubble.
And by the way, they murdered about 200,000 inhabitants, of which only a dozen were insurgents.
It's much worse in Gaza, ladies and gentlemen.
Israel has now given time to leave this zone by civilians. This may lead to some improvement of the fate of these people.
If they run away, what will happen to them?
Imagine that you want to evacuate the whole of Warsaw in one day.
Is it even feasible? Would anyone in common sense take such an action?
Where would they go?
Egypt, the closest.
Exactly, what you say, Egypt is the closest.
Not only that, Egypt has a history of wars with Israel.
They will gladly accept them.
Here, the economy works more than politics.
Egypt is in a bad financial situation.
And when I think that they had 2 million refugees, I know that it would be a financial blow to the budget of Egypt.
Maybe even a crushing one.
Of course, Poles can also take it well, because we host several million similar Ukrainian refugees.
And it costs us literally billions, which we obviously don't have in the budget, so we borrow.
Egypt is even worse.
They try at all costs to avoid getting involved in this conflict.
What would they get for it?
Several million refugees and probably some thousands of highly radicalized Islamists.
Only cons for Egypt.
Mr. Mariusz, but if a wave of 2 million refugees saves their lives,
to stop them, they will have to shoot them.
Our border with Belarus or the USA border with Mexico show that it is not necessary to shoot these people at the border.
There is no method of stopping thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people,
because even shooting here could not help.
Does Hamas have support, at least for the majority of Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip?
How much is it behind the back for this most combative and terrorist part of society?
Hamas is just one of many fragments of fighters and it is not very popular at all.
It started from purely social activity and was supposed to be a counterbalance for the Palestinian forces fighting Israel.
Over time, it transformed into quasi-police forces, where it fought crimes and social riots.
It has now turned into quasi-military forces.
We are talking about a small fragment, not very well funded,
and because of that, if you don't have money, you don't have a good back.
If someone is to get involved, he will get involved with those who will give him the best conditions.
It is already apparent that Hamas' position has strengthened significantly,
also in the eyes of Palestinians and the whole Islamic world,
which is why it will also financially and numerically strengthen.
In my opinion, Hamas has already won, and the more victims there are, the more it will gain.
One of Israel's first decisions after the attack was to cut off water, energy and gas supply to the Gaza Strip.
Will it bring results and will it not cause the radicalization of most of the Palestinians living in Gaza?
Undoubtedly, it must cause, because moving to such actions, which, in my opinion, are practically all perfectly qualified for war crimes,
cannot end well.
The more Hamas wins, the more Israel will use radical, inhuman, bandit ways of fighting it.
Civilization progress is that society begins to cope with even apologies or bestial behaviors in a civilized way.
In a way that is to guarantee a humanitarian approach.
If we wanted to fight the bandits in a bandit way, then what would we be different from them?
A question that is difficult to answer, but on my part the rest of the questions after the break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier.
Today, in an unusual role, I'm going to assess the international situation in Palestine and Israel.
In the previous great conflicts that took place there, neighboring countries were always involved in the war.
Syria, Lebanon, Egypt.
We talked a little about the complicated situation in Egypt now, and how other countries are behaving.
There is a new player there, a new great player - Iran.
What's going on there in the broader context, Mr. Mariusz?
This is, of course, a rather complex topic, because in our Western mentality we expect such a division.
Good, bad, there is nothing against the enemy.
It doesn't work there at all.
Now, in general, the whole system of forces in the Middle East is changing.
Until now, the US influence ruled there practically without discussion.
They distributed cards, they interfered, they protected their investments.
And we are mainly talking about the oil industry or other mining industries.
Currently, it doesn't work like that anymore.
Please note the rapid increase in Chinese-Russian influence.
The reference of very large methods of economic and political cooperation there
shows that the Arabs have had enough of the American hegemon,
who mixes soups in their bowls.
These are completely different societies.
There is a dualism in the way of thinking, a dichotomy.
On the one hand, we hate the Americans, but on the other hand, our elites do great business with them.
But we don't do anything about it, because the rich give us money so that we can fight the Americans.
It sounds like a crazy scheme.
That's why these countries are not uniform.
They are encased in various forces, ideas, influences, and economic interests.
It's not a matter of war, but a matter of very complex economic systems.
That's why we don't see a clear division of allies and opponents.
The situation in Israel has also changed.
In recent months, Prime Minister Netanyahu has reformed the judiciary
to influence the choice of judges, to limit the possibility of the Supreme Court of Justice
to vote on the government's decisions.
In a way, it even resembles the situation in Poland.
This also caused social resistance.
Part of the society was protesting.
We are actually dealing with the internal division of the Israeli society.
Maybe this has reduced their defensive capabilities?
Such actions must always reduce and weaken all state institutions and their effectiveness.
Analysts have noticed an interesting dependence.
When Netanyahu is to be deprived of power, a conflict or tragedy suddenly breaks out
and the opposition gives up on removing him, because then it would weaken the state too much.
I don't know if this is just an interesting coincidence or something more serious,
but it made me think a little.
We all look at what is happening, which way events will develop.
There are no signs that the situation should calm down.
Can all this be overcome under control?
I can easily make a logical path from this conflict, literally a few weeks before the World War.
The USA has already sent its forces there and is announcing military assistance.
I remind you that the USA is not at all popular in the East.
It's about big businesses.
Maybe we are just getting to the point when the remodeling of the entire system of forces
and economic influences in this part of the world is already happening.
What the British started by imposing the creation of the State of Israel
is about the way this existence was created and how it is maintained.
The West is practically speaking 100% pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian.
Instead of clearly criticizing, condemning and blocking the actions of Israel,
let's be honest, what is happening now in the eyes of the world is absolutely unacceptable.
And look at what escalation of international reaction it has caused.
It is a unified, unified political scene on practically every side.
Not only that, they are also financially and militarily supporting them.
I don't like it, to be honest.
Let's have equal rules for everyone.
If someone does something wrong, let's condemn it, let's impose sanctions.
This is what the international community is for, right?
But suddenly this voice disappeared.
Nobody says anything.
They don't say, ""Listen, you can't cut off the means of sustaining life for two million people.""
This is murder.
These are war crimes.
Why do we allow this?
I think this is a test for the entire Western civilization.
Are we able to put an end to actions that are unethical, that are criminal, to the bestiality of criminals?
We cannot respond with the same bestiality.
Is Hamas a gang organization?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it commits crimes.
Does it make us more serious to commit crimes against the civilian population?
Most people in the Arab world or in the Islamic world don't dream of murdering infidels.
I have friends from Iran and they told me something that I literally laughed at.
In our country, only two groups of people take care of religion.
Politicians and old women.
It's like in our country.
Normal people want to live, work, earn, do their own business.
Because most people have it that way.
The Islamic world is absolutely identical.
Only a minimal part of extremism is financed by the richest elite.
Which does it to sanction the maximum poverty of the majority of people.
And in this way keep order.
The truth is that at the source of everything lies a brutal, unfair economy.
And that's why most of the world's poor have a chance to exist extremists who gain support.
These are people who are simply desperate.
These are people who are simply very poor.
These are people who are simply unhappy.
But if people were living normally, no one would support any extremists.
Because no one who has a family, who has means of living, will not run in suicide attacks, slowly go for a walk with their children.
Mr. Mariusz, we can only wish ourselves and everyone that this conflict ends as soon as possible.
That we also manage to solve its root cause, for which it returns.
I wish you that.
Thank you very much for the conversation.
Economist, financier Mariusz Stefaniak.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.
See you.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial expert.
Today we're going to talk about the border between
common sense and economy.
The whole Poland is talking about Pandora's Gate affair
and it's hard not to hear about it.
It sounds pretty serious.
Watergate in the United States
is the president's office.
Our affair so far
has been only a joke
to an influencer known in the network as ""Stu"",
who is suspected of pedophilia.
But we're not going to talk about
his wine or his performances.
I wanted to talk about something else.
Personally, I'm surprised,
because I started watching these videos on the Internet,
watching, listening. I'm surprised
that people who are known
mainly because they are known
can make so much money on it
and gain so much popularity.
In my opinion, it's contrary
to common sense,
not to mention the economy.
I'll give you a few points at the same time,
so maybe one at a time.
Pandora's Gate itself came from the mythical
woman Pandora.
Beautiful, but not very honest,
quite deceitful, who was sent by the gods
for punishment.
And they added to her such a tight,
closed box.
All misfortunes were locked there
and after opening, they were released into the world.
Just like in the myth,
the same happened here.
Beautiful women, influencers,
but not necessarily deceitful or wise,
living in unmarried and loose relationships
with many often handsome,
usually rich and always
almost well-known idols of children and youth,
had dark secrets
that freed them to the world.
Among other things, that not many girls
were in a relationship with much older
idols with the participation of various forms
of sexual intimacy.
As one of the suspects explained in the media,
all the media should be accused
and condemned, the biggest companies,
singers and also parents
for what happened to their children.
We are talking about 12-13 year olds.
They watched music,
movies, YouTube channels,
where almost naked women
are waving and talking about sex
in such a way that I assure you
you would not be able to speak publicly.
And the biggest female idols
are actually such a modern form
of paraprostitution.
Let's look at the world
with the eyes of a teenager, at the world of economics.
What are the richest and most
famous women in the world?
Are they smart businessmen, inventors, scientists?
No, there is no such thing.
I challenge the listeners.
Find and give us
some very famous
and rich woman
who came to all this
alone, only with her own
work and talent.
Mrs. Marysia Maria Skłodowska-Curie
100 years ago.
She was not rich.
But she is famous.
But she has not lived for a long time.
I'm talking about what is currently,
what these 12-year-olds will admire.
Well, I can't think of such an example.
I have two models that, in my opinion,
explain almost all women's so-called
success in the world.
One, I call it sexy lala,
that is, I find a much older,
and the next one is an immoral
and usually not very talented artist
who has won millions because she knows
who to give herself to and does it many times over the years.
And she's not even their wife or lover.
She's a prostitute on the call.
We are talking about the biggest stars
of the television, cinema,
the world of music, who gave themselves
to the influential, influential guys,
for example in Hollywood, to get
million-dollar hangars, thus
throwing out the most talented and honest
women from work.
To the biggest stars in the world
in the style of Saima Haq, Ashley Judd,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie or Lady Gaga.
They were getting hangars for sex.
They were doing it,
although they were known and rich,
but they wanted to be even more famous
and even richer.
They were doing it out of greed.
And it works, sir.
Let's start breaking this phenomenon down a bit
from the beginning.
What do influencers actually do?
What do they offer their viewers or listeners?
How do they make money on it?
And probably the most important question -
how much can you make on it?
You can make a huge amount of money.
We're talking about tens of millions,
I can think of people who literally
made hundreds of millions of dollars.
As you say, being known for being known,
not having any specific
measurable skill, that you can do something,
I don't know, do.
Do you remember our hearing about Bad Light
and this transvestite?
I remember perfectly, but it's probably an example
different from the intended ones.
His campaign, Bad Light beer,
ended with the sale of the beer
starting to drop rapidly.
He didn't hit it.
Maybe he did well, but his client
didn't do the best.
It doesn't concern anyone.
It doesn't concern clients, it doesn't concern influencers,
and it doesn't even concern the company, sir.
They can lose tens of billions of dollars
and it doesn't affect them at all.
Because CEOs don't get money, sir,

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What do you want to hear?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
What's up, Mr. Mariusz? Today, we're talking about debts.
You know that on November 17th we celebrate the ""Day without debts"".
We're waiting for some social and informational actions.
I've looked into the data. It turns out that 2.5 million Poles are in the national debt register.
So they have problems with some payments.
Mr. Mariusz, is debt a problem of the one who has it or is it a social problem?
Indeed, this idiotic pseudo-holyday is supposedly going on since 2019.
Do you know who was the inventor of this?
Executors, right?
A living entity of debt collection.
Of course, this should change to the day of financial education.
But of course, no one would care about it, because I checked in the studies from September,
only 12% of Poles thought that their knowledge of finances is low or extremely low.
39% don't feel the need to increase them.
40% blame the government for their problems.
27% - bad luck or an event, just genius.
8% - some kind of spouse and so on.
60% or more don't see the connection with their finances and their actions.
This is absurd.
We live in very nice times, when people buy, spend money, borrow.
Lending is very accessible.
However, I still remember the movie ""Komornik"", which once made a very big impression on me.
It's true that it happened 20 years ago.
In Wałbrzych, which was then a city of poverty, bankrupt companies,
there were no life prospects, and the hero of this movie was a very ruthless Komornik,
who was moving to ruthless methods of debt collection.
But he was a state official.
Now there are no such gloomy movies, so the mood generally favors taking more loans.
Do you know any such ruthless methods of debt collection?
Nice, friendly?
Well, you can get along with someone and just hope that he will fulfill the contract.
By definition, most debtors do not have such a train to take responsibility.
It came from these statistics.
People do not see such a relationship at all and can actually blame everyone except themselves.
This is absolutely amazing and shocking to me that such people have a place in our society.
I have my favorite saying.
A man is in a bad company only in two situations in life.
When he is poor and when he is rich.
It's hard to have honor, sir, being in debt everywhere.
It's like having a hard time being an alcoholic.
Because these people have to lie from nature, because they can't tell you,
""Listen, I'll take money from you, but I won't give it back to you.""
Different people have different boundaries, so you can't put everyone in one bag.
But the general rule is that if you are very poor or very rich,
you have to get rid of most ethical rules, social norms, etc.
Otherwise, unfortunately, you will not be able to survive in this environment.
Mr. Marysia, let's move on to the reasons why people become indebted, at least by excess.
Are these reasons that they have such a character, they behave irresponsibly?
Are there any objective reasons for all this?
The gentleman just said that we are willing to point to the government,
to all other circumstances that justify us.
Is there some truth to this or not?
Yes and no.
The difficulty in answering this question is that there are so-called indirect and direct reasons.
So basically, why did this guy break into the store?
You can say directly, because he wanted money.
Okay, you're right. So he was a greedy jerk?
No, because, for example, he was a drug addict.
So why did he become a drug addict?
Because that's why, in the classic example, his single mother raised him.
Which is unfortunately a very big indicator of drug crime and various other offenses.
You know, you can go so far.
A direct reason may be, for example, the decision of some government on some rules,
taxation, or some exemptions, and so on.
But who chooses this government, sir?
What, aliens?
After all, you caused it, man.
Instead of talking about debts, let's talk about economic stupidity.
Why do people who are economic idiots, economic illiterates, have the right to vote?
Why do people who are economic idiots, economic illiterates, have the right to vote?
Why do second-rate economic idiots start in these elections?
And they talk about things, and promise things that are literally idiotic or unachievable.
The classic example of Wałęsa, the great nobleman, who promised 300 million to every Pole.
And why didn't he pay this money?
Never, to anyone.
I quote, ""I didn't know it was so hard.""
Anyway, I would put the whole queue of president idiots in the modern history of Poland.
The only one I could say I respect and don't consider an economic idiot was Olszewski.
Yes, he withdrew from politics, he no longer participates in it.
You know why?
If you look at the people who rule there, in this police, they distribute the main cards,
a person who has any knowledge, honor, respect for himself,
will not want to join them in any form.
But it's not them who are evil.
And what a miracle, such people are in such prominent positions.
For years, years, years, years.
Since none of the things they say and do,
has anything to do with good economy, logic, facts, or even simple honesty.
And when I see statistics that half of Poles don't see any problem with their economic knowledge,
I don't regret anyone who suffers from idiotic regulations, politicians, taxes,
and in a moment, very big problems in the whole economic country.
Because let's face it, we haven't paid for idiotic covid decisions yet,
which were scandalous in every way.
Mr. Mariusz, let's hope that our hearing contributed a little to the fact that we are raising this level of economic knowledge.
I invite you to the break.
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Today, about debts.
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
You said that it's hard to find gentle methods of paying off debts,
but as a country, as a state, as a society,
we have faced a special law on so-called consumer debt,
which is about what people who have overdue debts can do.
Last year, 15,000 Poles reported such consumer debt.
In fact, it was not reported, but it was brought to court, and the court announced it.
According to the court, all their property was then sold,
at least part of their debts were settled,
and the rest of the debts were annulled.
They will not be chased until the end of their lives.
They got the so-called ""new opening"", they can start from the beginning.
If we compare it with the methods that were used previously,
for example in ancient Rome, it looks quite civilized,
but it's not, because in ancient Rome, debtors lost their freedom and became slaves.
Do you agree that there is progress?
There is progress, but I don't know if there is anything to boast about.
The laws have been preserved, not only the laws,
but also the court records from the disputes,
just in the case of debts, in the case of slaves, and so on.
So we know perfectly well what the laws were,
how they were done, a few simple examples.
You mentioned that once a debtor, for example, was enslaved.
Yes, but there was a big difference.
Slaves, especially debtors, because I will not talk about other types of slaves here,
it was not allowed to give your children away many times.
Although in the Bible, in this part of the Old Testament, there were prohibitions.
How many times could you give your child away for a debt?
You could also give yourself away for a debt, or sort of work out those debts.
And there was also a constitutional limit described in the regulations,
that you could not be enslaved longer than ...
And it depended on the period it was, because we saw that the regulations were changing,
and from the country, from the culture.
So it was usually from a few, sometimes up to a dozen years.
So no matter how big your debt was, you were not allowed to keep more than, for example, five years.
And not only that, you were not allowed to kill, to torture,
you were also not allowed to sexually abuse these women.
There was literally such a record, probably even from the Sumerian period.
It was so very, very civilized.
And now, let's put it all together with what is currently.
People today can literally owe themselves for generations.
Of course, you mentioned this institution of consumer decline.
It is a mistake to claim that the procedure automatically cancels debts.
It is also a mistake to assume that the entire debt is canceled.
Unfortunately, this is not how it works.
The institution of decline, in general, in the regulations, including consumer decline in particular,
provides the possibility of settling debts, but never in its entirety, sir.
Here we give ourselves to the management.
Someone manages all our property, everything.
So if we totally lose everything, and in the times of slavery you did not lose your property.
Let him not take anything from you.
And now you had a choice to keep your entire property and work in a factory for a long time,
I would not be surprised if most people chose these old-fashioned regulations.
Recycling it, rather than giving up the profit of your life.
The owner of the slave had to take care that he had ...
Exactly, it's not that simple, sir.
He had to give him a flat, food, clothes.
It's not that funny, you know.
I also saw the regulations, also from the old tablets, very, very, very old.
Where there was even a record that the slave could not be charged with any fees.
It was clear that people were composing in this way, that's why a formal regulation came out.
Sorry, but if he's your slave, you take a car for leasing, you have to pay for its operation.
The leasing provider will not pay you for it.
And this is very reasonable.
Let's not be delighted with the current wonderful regulations.
And let's not throw mud at our ancestors, who were not idiots at all, sir.
And in the economy, I think they had much healthier views.
And a classic example, that is, this peasant.
The peasant paid all his taxes, debts and debts in relation to various items,
in the course of 1 to 3 months.
An average Pole has to pay it for 6 months.
And I'm talking about an average Pole, who has no debts and so on.
Well, Mr. Marysiu, but it is said that a small debt is a debtor's problem,
and a large debt or a large debt is already a problem of the one who borrowed money.
It's hard not to agree with it.
There are solutions like, for example, the banking information system.
There is a study of credibility.
I do not quite agree with you on the claim that you can borrow for generations.
Banks should ensure that our debts do not exceed a certain level, which we cannot pay later.
By chance, I worked in the central bank of the large bank,
and on my floor in the central bank there was the so-called Department of Difficult Credit.
That's exactly what you're talking about.
As far as I know, most of these most serious things
were actually the result of criminal activity.
Literally, bank directors were getting loans,
which they knew by definition would never be paid.
And they were never supposed to be paid, to make it funny.
In fact, it's not a problem, just a regular citizen, but a system problem.
As you say, banks should be watching.
Okay, but what should banks be watching?
The bank is a fictional entity, sir.
This is what people are standing for.
And these people have specific interests.
If we talk even more about banks that do not have a specific owner,
who would care that this bank was profitable,
then it leads to paradoxes.
If you add the whole political system to this,
then it leads to paradoxes.
So please look at what we're discussing,
all these scandals around the world,
the bank's bankruptcy in the US.
There were government institutions that were supposed to be watching,
and those institutions were not.
And it came out beautifully in this scandal,
which practically no one wrote about, sir.
Because the more loans there were, the better.
They had more money, sir.
And that these loans were completely fictional,
they didn't care about it anymore.
It is worth looking at the fact that the whole system,
which is out of the control of the citizen,
can be contaminated, sick, depressed.
I'm afraid we can think about it
completely seriously, looking at the Polish financial system
and the Polish system of creating debts and repayments.
The whole system causes depravation and corruption
of people who are supposed to act on behalf of the citizens,
on behalf of entrepreneurs.
Let's take a break and come back to this topic in the third part of the broadcast.

Our broadcast ""What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?""
Mariusz Stefaniak, economic and financial expert.
Today, the topic of debts, loans.
Let's talk a little about the scale of debt in our country.
Driving somewhere in Western Europe, the United States,
you can often see homeless people,
deprived of any property,
who are staying on the streets.
We don't have that yet.
Apparently we have about 30,000 homeless people,
but they don't show up.
Does this mean that our scale of poverty caused by,
for example, debt is relatively small?
What does it look like in other countries, Mr. Mariusz?
The fact that you don't see mass homelessness
unfortunately doesn't mean anything.
From my experience, it turns out,
practically in all the statistics I've seen,
that we can easily multiply official data
by 2, 3 or 5
if we want to know the scale of the phenomenon.
Let's also add that many really homeless people
have houses and families
and they are not in the statistics,
because they are not formally homeless,
but in practice, unfortunately, they are.
Let's add another element,
that many people in need,
for example, of the debtors,
do not have their own apartment
and the gigantic number of Poles,
I would put it as hundreds of thousands of Poles,
is on the border of homelessness,
although most of them don't even know about it.
How does it happen?
Very simple.
An example, 2008 USA.
Suddenly, the number of homeless people jumped rapidly.
It turned out that due to this crisis,
this speculation bubble,
most people didn't have money
for the houses they lived in.
They ended up on the street.
Banks took their houses, right?
Exactly!
Now let's look at the data in Poland.
How many apartments are bought on credit?
I think the majority.
The vast majority, that's right.
Another question.
How many percent of these people
could pay off this loan,
if suddenly we also had such a crash?
These are very real things.
It takes literally a few days
for something like this to happen.
A crash on the housing market,
like in the United States,
would suddenly make us out of 30
300,000 homeless people,
maybe even more.
This can have very important social consequences.
Because homeless people,
people deprived of property,
which is probably natural,
are more likely to commit crimes,
because they are desperate.
Isn't it in our interest
to keep the streets calm,
to control this phenomenon of mass decline?
Have you ever heard of a homeless gang?
Most crimes are not committed by
bankrupt or homeless people,
but by people living in social housing,
living on the streets,
from broken families, sir.
These are children of lonely mothers,
raised without fathers.
They are in prison,
and they get addicted.
And it's these drug addicts
who attack you on the street.
The statistics are so crushing,
that it's hard to believe
that no one does anything about it,
and even most people don't talk about it.
I will quote, for example,
the University of Silesia,
which has published a scientific paper.
The current father of a family of minor criminals,
they say, among other things,
that 73.33% of minor criminals
have experienced the loss of their father in their life.
If you want to talk about crime,
then talk about broken families.
I don't know if I've ever been upset
about how people blame the government
for their financial misfortunes.
It's exactly the same.
Why don't you talk about it in public?
Why don't you look for reasons
and don't fight it?
It doesn't make any sense.
The government can't do it.
This is, unfortunately, a situation
when a politician starts to govern the economy.
This is what I fundamentally disagree with.
To allow politicians to govern, sir.
A politician is not suitable for governance,
because he has no idea
about management or economy.
They just don't know about it.
The only question is when there will be a drama,
and not whether there will be a drama.
Because there is no method
to make it work well.
Mr. Mariusz, but I will ask you,
about our current situation.
You yourself mentioned a moment ago
that maybe we will be in a bankruptcy,
which will end with banks taking
houses, apartments from people
who are mortgaged.
The Polish Banking Association
is demanding to resign from credit holidays,
because it argues that until now
Poles have not used the money
they were given to buy
some unnecessary things,
they just either overpaid their loans
or made a savings.
Meanwhile, our declining government
wants these holidays next year,
because it explains that
we are in danger of bankruptcy.
So, on whose side should the state stand?
On the side of banks or on the side of people?
Should we simply not interfere
in such things?
You know my opinion about credit holidays
and other populist measures
that destroy the economy.
Yes, they only delay the sentence, right?
Not only delay,
they also worsen the whole situation,
because they teach people
to behave in a normal, irrational way.
The only situation
I would support
is something called
an economic lever.
It means a situation
when an entity is in debt
to increase the efficiency
of its capital.
To put it wisely,
it is a situation
when we borrow money
to achieve higher profits
from our activities.
Let's take a look at the scale.
You had one shop,
but thanks to the credit you open three shops.
You earn 20% per year.
The credit costs you 10% per year,
so you get 10% of each shop
for free.
Only it works
when your calculations
are correct
and nothing unexpected happens.
You pay an increased risk
for this extraordinary profit.
So if it's good,
it's going to be very good.
But if it's bad, it's going to be very bad.
That's why if you borrow
to open a layer
of the mechanism
where you will earn a lot of money,
very wisely,
but on the other hand,
if you borrow to have a nicer apartment,
a nicer car,
I'm sorry,
you are economic illiterates.
What you deserve
is the violation
of the law.
Thank you very much for today's conversation.
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist,
financial expert, our expert.
Thank you.
And Krzysztof Strauchman,
who gave the hearing.
See you.
In Chołazy and the area
105 and 2.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we share with you our reflections on how easily you can be deceived.
What did you hear there again?
I heard that we have to pay for the decoding of a lady named Katarzyna P.
Procedural reasons prohibit us from using her full name here.
She is a co-creator of the financial pyramid ""Umbergold"", a very famous affair 10 years ago.
Mrs. Katarzyna P. is to receive 6,500 euros, actually from us, from the state treasury,
for sitting 6,5 years without a court order in a temporary arrest.
The European Court of Justice has decided that this is an irrefutablely long time.
Who did wrong here?
Polish justice system chasing a fraud or European justice system defending fraud?
You know, it's hard for me to comment on the judiciary, because it's not my specialization,
but I can refer to the economic aspect.
The very situation that obvious frauds have been working for years
and despite many reports damaged, no one takes action.
This is a signal that the state is doing badly.
It's a signal on every level, from social foundations to the highest levels of executive power,
judiciary, judiciary.
Only people are looking for escape with capital from inflation,
because they don't want to be robbed by inflation.
Read by the government, of course.
But they fall into the hands of even bigger thieves.
It's like hunting with a target.
A frightened animal that runs away from noise,
falls under the gunfire of hunters.
I noticed this pattern in the economy of all countries,
where the state doesn't work in the interest of the citizens,
but the elite of ruling and financing or even buying politicians.
Today's topic will be especially important for the listeners
and will be an opportunity for us to give a few practical tips
on how to protect yourself from scammers, where to look for help.
We'll come back to this at the end of our broadcast.
First, I have a set of questions for you.
We talked about compensation for Katarzyna P.,
but it's not the only financial consequences of the state's failure in the Umber Gold case.
Because earlier the court admitted the compensation of 20 million for 200 people
who invested in Umber Gold and lost their money.
The court found that the state bodies were too late to deal with scammers,
too late to take action to punish these scammers.
The basic question that has been asked several times in this broadcast.
Should we be responsible for the consequences of our financial decisions ourselves
or should we look at some kind of state security umbrella?
Do scammers who have been deceived have to lose their money
or do all taxpayers answer?
I would answer in two ways.
One is the ancient Roman saying ""buy and beware"".
As you said, our interest is to protect our property.
Unfortunately, being an intelligent and experienced man
who works in the media world knows perfectly well
that it's not about us being careless or stupid,
but we're dealing with something much bigger.
Let's be honest, in such situations, in such affairs,
no one will be convicted of the crimes except for the so-called ""pillars"".
These are people who are purposefully put in front of scammers
to be chased.
And the bosses, i.e. the brain of the whole operation,
most often organized groups, the whole mafia,
use only stolen money and do not pose any responsibility at all.
No one ever blames them.
For decades, we have had systematic, gigantic frauds in Poland.
The system is such that politicians, consciously or not,
create a place that is friendly to the thief.
Who is talking about fraud?
The police commandant from the transport detonates a grenade launcher in his own office?
The grenade launcher?
It wasn't even released, of course.
Do you expect such people to be chased by some organized groups,
some mafia, some gigantic, billion-dollar frauds?
Well, recently I read the information that leaked from the police,
where they themselves admit that they are a complete failure
in gaining new staff.
No one respects them and doesn't want to work there,
because people are ashamed to work in the police.
This is probably a complete failure.
When I visit different countries, and you probably do the same,
we inadvertently notice how the police works there.
And it is either part of the criminal system, like in Ukraine, for example,
where they always had some money in their pockets for the police.
This is a system.
Another example could be, for example, Japan.
If you want to ask someone about something, ask the police,
because it is the safest, smartest, most sensible.
Everyone will know whether the police is there to give mandates,
to chase ordinary citizens, not criminals,
or maybe just to chase criminals and help citizens.
Let's remember what a policeman looked like and where he was.
They only stood at the intersection, guided traffic, were on the streets,
because where they were needed.
They didn't give any mandates, there was no such idea at all.
He was in charge of the order.
And now you won't see a policeman on the street,
let alone at the intersection, unless it's a big parade,
or some really macabre, big accident.
This is how the role of the police has changed.
That's why people are ashamed to be in the police.
Poop, drinking, drunkenness.
Other state institutions also functioned in the Amber Gold affair,
such as the Financial Supervision Commission,
which should prevent such a situation.
Before there is such a scale of fraud,
the Financial Supervision Commission publishes some public warnings,
warns people against suspicious films.
Why didn't it work then?
Let's remember the simple rule - the fish breaks its head.
In the Amber Gold affair, you probably realize
how well-documented the participation of people
at various levels related to various control services is.
Whether it's the tax authorities,
whether it's the special services, some ABW, CBŚ, police.
These people were more or less involved
in the fact that this affair could have lasted so many years
and could have stolen so many tens of millions of people.
Do you remember our hearing about this residential speculation bank in the United States?
The foundation of this bank was a special agency
called to rate these bonds.
It was they who actually stood behind it.
They gave high ratings, sometimes at the highest level,
to securities that were just garbage.
Here we have systemic errors that lead to gigantic twists and turns.
Because it's impossible to steal hundreds of millions of zlotys from thousands of people
without the support of the appropriate authorities.
It's not that everyone was a criminal there,
but some people turned their heads when they felt comfortable and profitable.
We'll come back to the topic of financial pyramids and how they work after the break,
which I invite you to.

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mariusz, Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we share with you our reflections on how easily you can be deceived.
Financial pyramids are an old invention, they have been working for a long time.
It is an invention that is still effective, someone can still get it.
You said that people run away from inflation with their money.
But 10 years ago, inflation was not that high.
Did the desire for earnings and greed decide then?
Why do we still easily believe in the initial profits offered by very suspicious companies?
Well, why do we play Lotto, for example?
The chances of winning are 13,983,816.
To win, you would have to spend 42 billion zlotys.
And people play. Why?
Because they lose little.
Yes, you are right.
This shows a certain scheme, because to understand a big scam, you have to understand a small scam.
There is a psychological aspect, ignorance of economics and mathematics.
The next aspect is a bit more serious.
Because such a lotto reveals that poor people go there most often.
No chance for big money gained from their skills.
Just as we talked about China and their gigantic housing scam.
Why did people invest their savings and not just their own?
So there they lost not only their money, but the money of the whole family, cousins, uncles, etc.
Why? Because they have no other chance of saving or multiplying their money.
That's what it's about. Because the state does not give them such a chance.
Poland has one of the most difficult, most complex and least friendly regulations in the entire European Union.
Don't be surprised if people have some options and someone says,
""Listen, you can earn here as much as you would run a business, which is a drama in Poland, a nightmare.""
People, just like in the lotto, if there is something poor, what chance does he have to get a million zlotys?
Oh, it's hard.
None. So what's left for him? People do it out of desperation.
So again, the bad government, stupid bribery of the officials, is a scheme to our response.
But companies like Ambergold devote a lot of money and attention to building their positive image.
Ambergold for a long time was a widely respected company, which was famous, there was a lot of positive information about it.
Anyway, it's a fairly common mechanism, because many companies of this kind, for example,
hire famous people to their commercials, actors, politicians.
Do these people really not know what they are participating in?
I would ask a different question.
Why didn't they care what they were participating in and was it fair or maybe not?
Maybe I'll give you some world-famous examples.
An infamous character of a super-famous producer who was behind Miramax,
that is Harvey Weinstein, who used sexually more beautiful actresses on a mass and system basis.
Literally everyone in the show business knew about it for decades.
And this is the most important thing, ladies and gentlemen, to remember, because it's not somehow talked about, it's hidden.
Everyone praised him publicly and, funnily enough,
practically all of his victims gave him public thanks, for example, when he won film awards.
Now, of course, they are considered great victims, and this guy is in prison.
Let's look more broadly at such phenomena, pathological phenomena.
It's everywhere. Do you think nothing like this has happened in Poland?
I don't have any evidence, but I suspect that such situations have certainly happened.
I think that this is much more than just ""happened"", because people are the same everywhere.
They have the same tendency to easy money.
There is only one difference, ladies and gentlemen.
Social consent for such actions and for the consequences in the case of catching.
In our country, being a thief, liar or fraudster has practically no consequences.
You can be in the government or the Sejm for years.
Let me remind you of the famous case of Sowa and her friends.
Highly-ranked people, also from the government, said scandalous things.
And do you know who was the only convict?
Yes, Kellner.
That's why we have these cases.
And so the only convict will be a couple of cogs or some Kellner.
But not those who really did nasty things and benefited from it.
Mr. Mariusz, ten years ago, when the Amber Gold case broke out, there were not many such cases.
At that time, there were probably 18,000 people injured, who lost a total of 850 million zlotys.
Indeed, these are figures that make a big impression.
But now the whole thing and the whole procedure has made us more common.
Actually, at any moment, each of us can become a victim of fraud.
Because we get all kinds of emails, phones.
We have to keep an eye on each other all the time so that someone does not reveal their personal data.
So that something does not happen, as a result of which we lose money.
It has become institutional.
Are international police organizations not able to deal with such crime?
Of course not.
And they have no chance of it.
The police have no chance of dealing with it effectively.
For you, I can give you one aspect, which I can say.
That is, politically, business-wise, the police are, to put it mildly, discouraged from catching certain criminals.
And even from delving into certain crimes.
And they are rewarded for not doing it.
Or let's say they do it indiscriminately.
They will not complete all the activities or they will not try very hard.
Let's always ask ourselves a question.
Does our society tolerate dishonesty, fraud, lying, theft?
And what consequences will people who will be associated with it, will be caught?
Well, it seems to me that we feel more and more powerless.
It annoys us, we are irritated by fraud, but I have not heard of cases of deceived people.
Usually, the petals fall.
Let me tell you a joke that I personally enjoy a lot.
How a tourist walks and suddenly sees a pool, next to which sits such a beautiful shepherd's dog.
So big and white.
Podhalański Shepherd.
Beauty.
Only that this dog is terribly sniffing, but also his heart is pounding.
And this shepherd is completely unmoved, he is poking a firecracker and does not pay attention to it at all.
The tourist was so intrigued by it that he could not stand it and went to the shepherd and said,
""Well, shepherd, what's going on? The dog is sniffing you terribly, I can't listen to it, and you are not doing anything here?""
""What am I supposed to do at night? The dog sat on the nail.
Why then? It will not get up.""
And the shepherd looks at him with wisdom.
""Or, mister, this is how it is in the world. Either a dog is too lazy or a nail is too blunt.""
Maybe we are just not stolen enough, not enough honest.
There is also not enough of this still inability,
purposeful or fake inability of officials, policemen, politicians.
Maybe this nail is just not sharp enough.
We still accept it and we still do not want to move our famous four letters,
so that this nail stops sticking in.
Because let's not count on someone to come up with a brilliant idea on their own.
That we will get to work, we will be strong in the center, we will be honest, we will not steal, we will not take bribes.
The world does not work like that.
So as long as there is no social, very strong pressure,
forcing effects, for example, from officials, politicians, policemen, from mass media,
there is no other method than waiting for the next scandal, because it will be, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Mariusz, it's time for the second break.
The second break.
The second break.
The second break.
The second break.
This is ""Granie"", Mr. Mariusz.
We're back to the subject of financial pyramids, big scams.
I personally have the impression that modern technology is a bit of a help to scammers,
who are doing great on the Internet.
Because in the past, to get a loan, you had to fake someone's signature,
fake his documents, identify yourself and go to the bank.
And today it is enough to know the PESEL number, know a few personal data,
to get a large loan, even if it's on the Internet, and not at the bank.
Anyway, someone else will pay this loan for someone else.
Do you agree that civilized amends have turned against people?
Why else would it be?
All inventions work exactly the same.
Once, to attack someone, you have to be strong, gather a whole gang of similar killers,
practice for years, and by the way, it was easy to die.
And the caught was publicly cut and hanged.
Currently, as long as the anemic with a gun can attack anyone effectively,
and at most he will end up with a life sentence at the cost of the victim.
Not only that, even an even bigger anemic, who only has a keyboard in his hand,
can steal millions, and even sometimes billions, without leaving the house.
And he will never be judged, in most cases,
and even convicted of any crimes.
I will remind you of the biggest scandal in Poland,
called the mother of all Polish scandals.
According to the indictment, the state lost 120 million dollars,
9 million marks, 18 million francs, etc.
The losses were absurdly gigantic.
Another mega scandal.
The famous Art-B, the men of the Gąsiorowski bank, were the richest people in Poland.
They had colleagues, such as Jerzy Dziewulski, head of the anti-terrorist brigade.
They had marshals of the Sejm, Senate, ministers, deputies, bank managers.
Are you surprised that they managed to steal hundreds of millions for years?
And do you know why all these scandals were revealed?
Not by the police, not by the police, not by the Ministry of Justice, not!
The scandal was revealed by an ordinary official,
who controlled one of the companies where all the money was stolen.
Of course, he did not survive it, just as his superior did not survive it,
and many other people who were involved in the chase and revealing of these bandits.
So let's move on to a very practical part of our hearing.
Mr. Mariusz, how to find out that the company we want to give the money to is the pyramid?
Which one will we actually lose everything sooner or later?
First of all, incredibly useful stories about profits and low costs,
as required to achieve these great profits.
Something is too good to be true.
And here this rule works perfectly.
This is usually the main warning signal.
Next, who manages it, who is behind it?
If it's a bunch of strangers who suddenly start trading gold and amber,
what are their experiences, what are their legitimations?
You know, to do something well in economics, business, management,
you need to have years of experience, make many mistakes.
Another, third rule.
Never invest in something you don't know about.
You don't know about diamonds, don't invest in diamonds, you don't know about gold, don't invest in gold.
This is the golden rule of investment.
If you follow these three rules, you won't be able to fall into any financial trap.
Mr. Mariusz, I suspect that your rules will result in people keeping money in a sock or on a bank account.
You're right, because people don't have knowledge.
I think what you're doing is very wise, noble and helpful,
because educating people in the economy is the foundation for them to learn what to invest in, what makes sense,
what are the real gains you can get from any business,
these are very valuable lessons, but they don't learn it in school.
Not only do they not get this knowledge, they are also being fooled by celebrities, politicians,
by complete nonsense or aimless fraud.
Mr. Mariusz, as a journalist, I had a few opportunities to talk to people who lost a lot of money,
sometimes they saved their lives in suspicious businesses,
because they simply trusted the offer too much.
These are terrible dramas.
I talked to people who had suicidal thoughts, who were even in danger of moving to something
and, I don't know, they will shoot these fraudsters if they see them on the street.
Are there any methods to at least partially recover this money?
Is it better to go to a long-term court,
or do you have to look for help from the police, institutions,
or just hire gangsters who will go and beat someone to get our money?
Yes, there are such opportunities, we are even talking about amber gold.
Not everyone lost money, some of them can even recover it.
There was a group appeal and they were actually sentenced to a million zlotys in some cases.
After the appeal, the regional prosecutor's office in Gdańsk, the district prosecutor's office in Gdańsk,
was convicted of the offer,
which means that the prosecutor's office is guilty of people being robbed.
The funny thing is that the money will go to this from the budget.
The Poles will be robbed to give to other robbed Poles.
But where to look for help?
Good question.
Looking for it in typical places is ineffective.
Fortunately, thanks to the activities of people like you, for example,
who inform certain things, it is an increasingly well-known topic, a significant topic,
and people are getting more and more, as you said, they are starting to get nervous and ask uncomfortable questions.
This has forced the government to take some action.
Where can it be reported?
I would personally recommend NASK.
Since 2018, they have been officially engaged in this in Poland.
They have a special website that they manage, incident.cert.pl.
Please note that very often these crimes are not just an ordinary attack on us on the street,
but on something we call sociotechnics,
where the final is often irreversible loss of a part or even the entire savings of our lives.
I suggest that you report any suspicion.
Normally, it is difficult for the police, but better methods are created.
I decided that my foundation will create such a website,
where we will give a set of simple tips and we will give all the links where and in what situations to report.
It is very simple.
Most often you can do it literally by one SMS or one email.
You do not do the whole very unpleasant and long-term and often unfortunately not very fruitful procedure.
It is enough that you send, for example, a message that you received or an email from a Nigerian prince.
This type of thing we have to redirect to special people who know the subject matter and it is not the police, unfortunately.
And there are just big chances that, first of all, we will not fall into the clutches of scammers.
And secondly, these scammers will be really blocked, chased.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you very much for today's conversation.
Let's hope that its effect will be that at least one or two people will warn their money against scammers.
Readers, we would like to ask for your attention in a moment.
Practical information on how and where to seek help.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation of More Wisdom.
Today about the intentions of American billionaires, about honesty in business
and whether we should support honest or dishonest business.
American billionaire Warren Buffett has been selling stock from stock exchanges regularly for a few months,
which he bought earlier.
What do you think?
Why does he need the capital he concentrates on?
Is he preparing something new, some new business?
Or maybe he's afraid of sudden drops in the stock exchange and losses in the stock market?
This is probably much more serious and means more than only listeners could deduce from your words.
We're talking about someone completely unique here, the so-called ""Zomach's Whistle"",
the ""legend of investment"", about something I don't remember yet in my life,
that is, the compression of his capital on a scale not seen.
Reason number one that comes to mind.
Well, the guy went crazy.
Well, he's got his years, Mr. Warren Buffett is over 90 years old.
Yes, well, maybe something has been moving in his brain and he's starting to do such strange things.
The second thing in his head is blackmailed in some unusual way.
Maybe he's got into some crazy debt.
Maybe some woman has an influence on it.
These are the typical reasons.
Well, of course, you mentioned a different version.
You said that maybe he's planning something, maybe he wants to run away with this money, shares,
and maybe for some reason he needs to have such a supply of cash.
I won't be able to talk in a few minutes and explain all the options,
but I can give you a summary and maybe some additional links, materials,
for audycje.com.pl, which is the initiative that we came up with together during one of our auditions.
Mr. Marysia, let's go back to Warren Buffett,
because the listeners need to understand the scale of the savings that the older man has accumulated.
He didn't spend them, it's cash, it's capital that can be immediately disposed of.
How much did he take?
We're talking about pretty serious money here.
As I quickly looked at his reports, which I give to the participants,
in the last quarter alone he sold shares worth 5.3 billion dollars in the last three months.
At the same time, it increased the cash by 10 billion in half a year.
It's almost like he's adding 5 billion every three months.
We're talking about 10 billion in cash, but his capital is estimated at 7.6 billion,
which is less than 1.5%.
But how much does he lose on it?
What is the cost of withdrawing this money?
Because, of course, this money works for him.
I quickly calculated it. We assume an average of 21% per year on our investments.
Income from the invested capital, right?
Yes. Inflation in the USA in September, calculated in CPI, was 3.7.
It turned out that this would give him about 60 million in costs of this quarterly withdrawal.
So he has to think that he will earn more, because if he gets such a cost, it means that we have to pay for it.
I quickly calculated it. It gives 240 million such costs per year, plus what he normally gets from the profits,
which is another 50 million.
So he has to count on the fact that he will earn 300 million or more from the 10 billion he has withdrawn in the last few months.
Because, in fact, if you add up what he already had before, he currently has 157 billion dollars.
And this is, ladies and gentlemen, the largest his cash position in history.
Mr. Marysia, but huge money, because 150 billion dollars, times 4, is about 6.
Almost 700 billion. And you know, it's more than the entire Polish budget.
So one person really has more money in his hand than we as a whole nation plan to have for the whole year.
Including the deficit, i.e. the debts we owe.
Mr. Marysia, but he doesn't do anything with this money, he keeps it. And it seems to have been going on for a few months.
What is he waiting for?
You know what? This is a question for a billion dollars.
It may indeed be one of the scenarios I mentioned earlier, but it may also be that he is planning some kind of investment.
For me, this is a clear signal. He predicts that there will be a breakdown of the companies' notations.
Let's face it, there is no other logical conclusion I can draw as an economist from these actions.
Where a person does something unprecedented in the history of his business.
He is called a believer, a legendary investor, known for predicting various events, effective prediction.
But knowledge is knowledge, facts are facts.
Economy is economy, so you know, everyone can come to similar conclusions on a large or small scale.
We see the same phenomena, only we have different possibilities.
But in this case, if there is going to be a crisis, why is it worth having cash with you in times of crisis?
Great question. To make purchases, ladies and gentlemen.
The biggest crises, the biggest misfortunes are the biggest investment opportunities.
Art is based on two things. Number one, on timing, meaning waiting for the right moment.
The difference between a good investor and a bad investor is sometimes just a few seconds, a few hours or a few days.
The second aspect is to estimate what we are going to invest in or what assets we are going to get rid of.
This also distinguishes winners from losers.
For example, he invests a lot in government debt papers, which everyone has been running away from on a massive scale.
He hopes that private companies will go down, but the value will be kept in government papers.
He assumes an economic collapse, but he does not assume the collapse of the government, some civil wars, etc.
Nor will they conquer America. Through China, for example.
He is not afraid of that at all. I suspect that it could indicate that he is counting on the other side.
It may turn out that he predicts that America will join some war, or that a war will break out and America will be in this war, but he will be on the side of the winners.
This is the subtle difference.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to take a break, but we will be back to the topic in a moment.
Let's go.

Greetings, Mr. Mariusz. Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about American billionaires and we are trying to guess what they are up to.
What are they planning? What are they preparing for?
We talked about Warren Buffett, but now let's change the subject a bit.
Let's talk about someone who was already mentioned half a year ago.
A year ago, the FTX cryptocurrency exchange was bankrupted in the United States.
It was founded and managed by the billionaire, Sam Bankman.
The trial of the accused fraudster, Sam Bankman, has just begun in New York.
The prosecutor will want to prove to him that he was planning to mislead many investors who invested a lot of money in his business.
However, the defense says that he just didn't make it, that what can always happen in business happened.
So he got into bad conditions. Where is the truth?
Actually, he was already considered guilty by the court of the accused of fraud in order to deceive the clients of the FTX exchange.
And he was supposed to cheat them for a total of 10 billion dollars.
It is estimated that he will get over 100 years in prison.
I will be honest, I don't think anyone expects a different result than a sentence for many years, i.e. in fact, life imprisonment.
So it's not worth cheating investors in the United States.
Why? It's perfectly worth it.
Because he will go to prison and probably in this prison he will wait until his death.
I will remind you, maybe only our hearing about Amber Gold.
Well, usually single people fall in, and someone who is hiding behind it is safe, right?
Exactly. This is the same mechanism where Sam Bankman will go to jail, but he didn't do it himself.
Why is no one sitting on the accused's bench with him?
There should be dozens of people on this bench.
And these are very serious people, on serious positions.
It's not like some 20-year-old boy suddenly thought he would be turning billions of dollars.
This is not how it works.
They were investing in it and launching it, promoting it.
The most serious institutions, including super-well-known banks, well-known funds.
In general, there are no such people in the prosecution, no one talks about them.
Where are these billions, sir?
They just physically don't exist.
Or formally they don't exist.
Someone owns them.
No one talks about it.
One boy will go to jail and what?
He won't bring the money to the robbed people.
Mr. Mariusz, listening to the information from the Bankman's trial,
all this business of his, the cryptocurrency exchange, the second company he founded, Alamada,
make the impression of interest directed by completely irresponsible people, by young people, children.
They just had the principles of fair business in their nose, but they actually created it in an absolutely arbitrary way.
Such people should not run a residential store, at least in my imagination.
Meanwhile, they were turning billions of dollars, which they also received from investors.
Where is the wisdom of American investors?
I will not ask about the supervision of the state, because you have always criticized that there is no such supervision.
How could the Americans invest such a lot of money in the embezzlement?
It's the same as the Poles, the same as all the nations of the world.
Americans are the same, there are also the peasants, there are also the fools.
I remember our hearing where I said that there are 50 million people who are just morons, formally, from a scientific point of view.
I suspect they don't have millions of dollars.
No, they don't, but they choose those who have.
If the society is not properly educated economically, has no great awareness,
is not even aware of what it can do, that's why we have such scams like FTX or Amber Gold or all the others.
There is one guiding principle in all of this for me.
The connection of scammers with officials and politicians.
And this is actually a mandatory point for some big fraud to be created.
All the biggest frauds in the world have the same rule.
So they are not a problem of fraud, but an economic and political system, which, let's face it, we co-create and accept.
Who is to blame, sir, that a fox is a chicken?
A fox? No.
A lazy dog that doesn't watch, only sleeps, fat in his shoes, a drunk host that doesn't fix the fence.
Let's not blame the fox for being a fox, or the fraud for being a fraud.
If you don't blame all the frauds, it's the occasion that makes a thief.
Let's reduce the number of crimes, by reducing the number of occasions, by reducing the social acceptance of being a fraud.
If we accept frauds, thieves, at the highest positions in the country, ladies and gentlemen,
and you do it openly during the elections, once, once, once, once, for decades,
then on what basis do you expect that you will not be robbed?
If we look at Warren Buffett and say ""Oh, he's a genius"" and so on, ok, yes, he is a genius and a unique person,
that he has the knowledge, the courage to act differently than everyone else, but he is unique in a different way.
In the sense that he, as the best in the world, without a doubt, can make money on it.
He can capitalize on it in an amazing way and most importantly, he does it systematically and what's even more important in business,
he is honest, verbal, in relation to his investors.
Because this is the contradiction of the fact that I have some Amber Dole or Sam Bankman or that kind of thing.
You put Warren Buffett and Sam Bankman in one audition.
For me, it's just a brilliant move.
Because you showed multimillionaires from two corners of the world of economics.
A man who for decades has been bringing systematic, promised profits and has never failed, that is Warren Buffett.
And a guy who promised pears on a camel and turned out to be a total thief and a fraud.
And now the question is what is the economy? Is it like this or like that?
Ladies and gentlemen, how is the whole world like this and like that at the same time?
We have day and night at the same time.
We have winter and summer in one year.
The world is very, very balanced, organized.
If we have Sam Bankman, we must have Warren Buffett, otherwise nothing would work.
We have honest people, we have thieves.
The only question is what we support, what we are contributing to.
You were a bit of a snitch in me, because I was overwhelmed by the waves of examples
that show the lack of ethics and honesty in business.
Mrs. Mariusz, I propose to continue the discussion and move it after the break.
The end
The end
What is the game, Mrs. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the Foundation Więcej Mądrości.
Today about the intentions of American billionaires, about honesty in business
and whether we should support honest or not honest business.
Mrs. Mariusz, recently there was also information in the media about the practices of the Amazon company,
which was to manipulate the price of its goods by using special software.
All this was to increase their profits.
And again, the question is whether in business you can do everything to increase your income, increase your profits.
It seems that even a well-known company like Amazon used something like that.
It had to be used, otherwise it would not be who it is.
The situation has reached the point where you can talk loudly about the scam system
on which the largest companies in the world are getting rich, and thus the richest people in the world.
Here it is really important that we start to distinguish who became a rich man because he worked hard, honestly.
And it is possible, because the method of theft is a faster method.
I will give an example that the largest wealth in Great Britain, now super respected, was created by piracy.
There is even a saying that the first million must always be stolen.
These are the decisions that we make in life.
If someone wants to be rich at all costs, become a criminal.
This is just the only method.
Amazon, for millions of customers around the world, was synonymous with cheap buying.
Many people gave up shopping for its suppliers, choosing Amazon, convinced that it simply sells them the cheapest possible goods.
It turns out that some extra money was added.
They are doing great, it seemed to them.
This is the key, this is the magic word, ladies and gentlemen, to solve almost all economic puzzles.
Stop believing what someone tells you.
Just check, that's why we created this website audycy.com.pl, so that you have the opportunity to put some data, links, references, materials there.
So that it is not the word of a man who speaks somewhere on the radio, typical talking heads.
No.
This is what it is about, that if there are no facts, evidence, only words, then we welcome the world itself, the bank itself, and other scams, burglaries, etc.
But if someone pays dividends many times over the years, it shows that what he promises makes sense.
If someone tells you some absurd things, that this bitcoin will grow by a thousand percent, it will be worth a million, it really does not sound real.
So let's stop believing and start knowing.
Mr. Marysia, but how can a statistical client like me check the way the price of the goods sold by Amazon is calculated?
I can compare how much a TV or skis cost in this store, how much in this store, choose a cheaper product of the same quality.
However, when all sellers start to increase prices, I am helpless.
Yes, you are right, you are doing great.
We have two methods, that is, analyzing, comparing prices, and it is more difficult than you think.
Not super incredible, but not so simple.
Secondly, you have taken an incredibly dangerous thing, the trend in the world, i.e. monopolization, globalization of businesses,
that is, simply speaking, trade contracts, business contracts, which are illegal, but are absolutely common, they actually rule the whole world.
Let's look at the price of the bad things, we also had auditions, fuel, coal, no one calculates it on the market, it is just an obvious, literal, obvious conspiracy at the level of world agreements.
Well, from this conspiracy, Putin started to break out a bit, well, now he is of course the worst man in the world, because he started to sell 30% cheaper, for example, this oil.
Breaking this price conspiracy, which was the USA and the OPEC, they just determined how much barley crops they would get, and because of that, what will be the price on the world markets, because the demand is more or less constant,
because it was known what will be, how will be, and these rich people, they just become even richer, this Amazon can do such things, because they have huge money at their disposal.
Big investors, who agree, set prices, or sell something en masse, and then the price drops, everyone starts to sell in panic, or they buy, then the price rises, everyone says ""Oh, that's great, we buy"", this is the famous pump and dump.
Exactly the scheme in EFTELIX, we pump this price, and then we throw it to the bottom, and now do whatever you want.
You encourage to support the economy, which is guided by the rules of ethics, but I wonder what chances does a single client, a single person, has in a fight with such corporations, which use this kind of mechanisms, probably not big.
The opposite, do you remember what is my favorite definition of revolution? This is something that you can really write on the wall. The revolution is when everyone understands that the rest thinks the same. The revolution is not a loud minority, but a silent majority.
Do you know how Hitler came to power? Not through the SA militias, it was not them, but a silent majority, which knew that their government was simply stealing them, they live in luxury, and people are starving.
Hitler came out and said ""Ok, I'll change that"", and this silent majority of so-called ordinary Germans said ""Ok, we love you, we give you our full blessing, do what you have to do, leader"", and he did.
He won the elections.
Exactly, but it's not because he was some crazy guy who came to power, it's not true, it never works like that in the world.
This single client has the greatest power, there is a famous saying in the economy that the client votes with money.
Our foundation has released such a tool, such a solution to verify the largest global companies, in terms of what you give money for. We give such tools.
And that's why I allow myself not to agree with you on the fact that a single client has no influence.
On the contrary, it's him who rules, he decides, he can overthrow the political-economic systems. Who overthrew the communist party, sir? Ordinary people who said ""We are fed up, we are not afraid of your tanks, police batons, your ideologies"", we don't believe in this ideology anymore.
We don't believe in this Lenin anymore. Thanks to you, ordinary people, the individuals.
This is another topic for another very interesting hearing. Mr. Mariusz, thank you very much for today's conversation. We encourage you to visit www.audycje.com.pl.
You will find there not only recordings of our auditions, but also a lot of other interesting information. Thank you very much for the interview.
The optimist in this conversation was Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist. The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman. See you!

[music]
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
I wanted to talk to you today about earnings,
and this is a difficult topic,
although it concerns absolutely everyone.
And we all generally complain about our earnings,
and meanwhile, as I read on the Internet,
in Bangladesh, the minimum wage,
and this is after the increase,
which will come in December,
will be $114 per month,
that's 456 zlotys.
For comparison, the current minimum wage in Bangladesh
is $75, which is about 300 zlotys.
In Poland, the minimum wage is 3600 zlotys.
In January, it will increase to over 4000 zlotys.
So in Poland, it's about 10 times more than in Bangladesh.
Can we compare, Mr. Mariusz,
the minimum wage level in different countries like Poland and Bangladesh?
Can we conclude that we have a perfect wage?
The wage is only a number.
The purchasing power of a given currency is counted,
and also the level of life provided by it.
You can be a rich man in one part of the world,
and at the same time an average man somewhere else.
Let's look at Poland,
where, as far as I remember,
a German or a Frenchman had a few hundred percent of their average pension.
For the last many years,
the idiocy of the EU has shown
that even the richest countries in Europe
are systematically getting poorer,
but still have an advantage over us.
I was always told, Mr. Mariusz,
that the pension depends on the efficiency.
The efficiency in such a slum in Bangladesh is high.
Yes, they have amazing efficiencies there.
You probably wear a shirt or pants there.
Let me check for fun.
Such experiments have been done.
It always ends up with some half-slave or even completely slave work.
Including, very often, children's work, ladies and gentlemen.
So maybe you should start looking at the marks.
You are actually enslaving these people
through your decisions.
I mean, a company that has a well-known brand will do a promotion.
Because they literally buy it for money.
For them, such a workshop is money.
That's why these products and materials are money.
Do you know what costs them the most?
Packing and transport.
Most people have no idea.
Or, of course, who is supposed to tell them that?
What do they tell them at school?
The media?
Well, the media say what they are paid for.
Unless there is really no way out and there is a big scandal.
We were talking about, for example, the million-dollar labor camps in China.
You probably have some things at home that the slaves physically and really did.
Anyway, the ethnic minority, which is totally enslaved and exterminated
on a scale that you would think Hitler.
This is a pentagon in the current China, with which everyone trades.
Mr. Mariusz, let's get back to the issue of wages.
I have a question of a fundamental nature, which I often ask.
Should the state authorities intervene between the employee and his employer
and set some level of minimum wages?
Or should it be left to some market game,
the negotiating skills of an employee who can bargain a little more?
The only system that interferes with the economy is communist ideology.
As far as I know, it has never ended well.
We currently have a massive attack of communist ideologies in the Western world.
The effects are visible to the naked eye.
If we don't stop it, it will end as always.
That is, an economic collapse and most often mass and million-dollar deaths.
Because that's exactly what history teaches us.
An example from Bangladesh goes on.
For these wage negotiations and to set a new level of minimum wage,
a series of demonstrations took place.
And it was such a heavy start with the police.
Several people were injured, two people died in the start with the police.
Can you imagine that we will be with our employer
set our wages by running away to strikes, demonstrations and beatings?
I think it's inevitable. It's just a matter of time.
The water is flowing from the bath, until the urbian is gone.
The media does not show what is happening.
But such things, demonstrations, fights with the police,
are happening in practically every country in the West.
The famous protest in Canada.
We are talking about at least hundreds of thousands,
some people were talking about million-dollar sins.
People who openly told the government, ""No, we are fed up with it.""
Canada was synonymous with wealth, luxury.
Yes, and peace.
Yes, of course.
Let's take the Netherlands now.
What is happening there? What are the farmers' fights with the government?
It is not somehow commonly spoken about.
It is everywhere. People are extremely dissatisfied.
The media, of course, masks it.
But at some point, like with the Zban,
there comes a moment when people are fed up.
In my opinion, in Poland, we are still holding on somehow.
The Poles are extremely persistent, extremely helpful and extremely understanding.
But even the Poles can say ""enough""
and even stand up to the largest military force in the world,
that is, the Warsaw Pact.
Mr. Mariusz, but there are some civilized methods.
There are three-way commissions with the participation of entrepreneurs,
trade unions and representatives of the authorities,
where such things are simply negotiated and established in a civilized way.
Can you give me an example of such success anywhere in the world?
Because I don't know.
In Poland, it was decided that the minimum wage will be 4,242 zlotys from next year.
And it's in such a commission.
And you think they understand it as a success, right?
Well, from the point of view of an employee, it will increase by 500 zlotys,
so it's probably some kind of success.
First of all, the employees do not determine this in any way,
only the intermediaries who live from it to make it bad.
Both sides live from the work of these employees.
They literally parasitize on them.
What conditions will the dog's life set in?
Such that it eats the best.
This is the whole problem,
that there is no such thing here that the workers really exist in their name.
I will give an example from abroad, a very large one.
Jimmy Hoffa, who was the most important union activist in the United States.
Practically, he had more strength than the president of the United States, sir.
I once watched a movie about his uninteresting arrangements.
Let's use our initiative again, which we have created together.
audycje.com.pl
I can just throw some material on this topic there,
so that you realize what the system looks like in reality
between the government and the unions or unions.
Because there it was exposed in an amazing, undisputed way.
Choosing another president of the unions will not change anything.
Because the system does not change, the system does not change.
Because both sides that negotiate on behalf of the workers live from the workers.
The mafia ruled the unions in the United States.
This is how the world works, ladies and gentlemen.
If any of you is thinking that we have it different, then think again.
All people have the same advantages, the same disadvantages.
Will we allow this bad defect to flourish?
Or maybe we will try to eliminate as much as possible these pathological systems?
We will continue the topic after the break.
Thank you.
The end
The end
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist, president of the Foundation ""Więcej Mądrości"".
Today we are talking about earnings, about pensions of each of us.
I have never done this before in our hearing, but I refer to the Bible.
In the Gospel there is such a note - ""A worker is a good person for his payment.""
Well, I'm in this situation right now, I've never employed anyone,
I didn't have to set any salaries for anyone.
But how to understand, Mr. Mariusz, a good salary?
What should it depend on, how should it be shaped?
Exactly as it is described in the Bible.
The Bible, especially the initial parts, were documents written by the smartest people in the world.
And the rules they described there prepared the foundations for a successful economic and social life.
I will not comment on the dogmatic elements, of course, but the same economic part written there.
As you know, I managed and manage companies, it is my profession.
Sometimes I had hundreds of people under me.
And I can safely say that maybe about 10% had a decent salary,
most of them had below what they should have to live decently.
So you don't have to wonder if you can afford a better meal on a given day, if you feel like it,
and you don't have to count money until the end of the month.
Unless you have some bigger or unplanned expenses, of course.
This is the guarantee of your children's livelihood, which does not force them to constantly listen to ""Dad, Mom can't afford it.""
It's funny that on the scale of the whole society we have managed to scandalously cheat on the pay.
Forgetting that for centuries, if one man in the house had a degree or a profession, he could support his wife and children.
Today, with an average pension, almost no one survives, certainly not decently.
Officially, it is about 7300, in reality we get about 5000.
May you keep your wife and children in Poland.
I wish you good luck.
So the need is at least two people to bring so much, and then we can talk about a decent life.
Mr. Mariusz, I just made a small comparison, because in Poland there are, of course, institutions that deal with social affairs,
and these institutions account for something like a minimum social.
Currently, such a minimum social, i.e. ensuring the most basic needs of life, actually guaranteeing only existence, sustainability,
is about 3000 zlotys for a two-person family, and for a two-person family, i.e. a marriage with a child, it is 4350 zlotys.
This directly shows that by earning a little more than this minimum wage, and most people earn like that,
we are not actually able to support the family and provide it with even a minimum of existence.
Exactly, this is my point.
I don't know if you remember, but in one of our previous auditions we showed how huge the number of people in Poland live below or on the border of poverty.
Most people in Poland, ladies and gentlemen, have no savings, the data is published, and a large part of Poles are in debt.
These are really terrifying symptoms that bad things are happening in the country, and no matter what the minimum wage, average, is,
it doesn't matter, it's just numbers.
Ladies and gentlemen, you don't have money, you don't have savings, you don't have insurance, but you have a large part of debt.
Well, the GUS calculates and publishes average pensions and average salaries every quarter.
Currently, it is about 7000 zlotys brutto, i.e. before tax evasion.
On hand, it is a little over 5000.
Is this the level that, in your opinion, provides a decent life?
The level of the middle class? Or should the middle class earn more?
No, this is the level of vegetation.
If you take into account that you have children, a wife, you pay for some apartment, you have a car,
you will always look at how many days are left until the end of the month.
Well, Mr. Mariusz, let's be honest, for a four-person family, the level of payments providing a decent life, how much should it be?
Double the brush, you have to have about 15,000.
And what, do you think that this private entrepreneur, not forced to do it, is able to pay that much?
Or he just doesn't want to pay that much, or he is not able to pay that much, given the current tax burdens?
You asked an incredibly complicated question.
Most employers are not able to pay that much due to the level of burdens imposed on them.
That is, these dear rulers who live on the burden of their citizens, entrepreneurs, with the highest taxes.
Secondly, the entrepreneur will pay only as much as he has to.
It is one of the basic fundamental rules of the economy.
Maximum effect with minimal impact.
If people agree and are satisfied with the fact that they get a dollar, it's great.
If in a given country there is poverty, hunger, as we said in Bangladesh, there are many other countries,
what employer would like to pay them more?
It doesn't make any sense.
If there is a very high wage, that is, people with low education, low skills go to work
and there are millions of people to choose from, why should we overpay?
If we have people who are important to entrepreneurs, he is able to pay them absurd amounts of money.
I personally know entrepreneurs who pay their employees more than they earn.
More than the president earns, right?
Yes. So an employee, even the lowest rank, can earn more than the president.
Only when do we pay such an employee?
When he brings value. If someone comes to this machine and we can teach everyone to work on the machine,
why should we pay him a lot?
But if we have a machine specialist, I know an example,
there is one physical employee who can program CNC machines.
He is naturally late, he is somewhere, he is not afraid of any manager, president,
because there is no one in this company who could do it.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that you learn, that you acquire skills, qualifications,
because if you are one of the millions of people who can be employed,
then why would anyone want to pay you?
Mr. Mariusz, break number two. We will return to a very interesting conversation in a moment.
More than a machine.
More than a machine.
More than a machine.
I am Stefan, an economist, a financier. Today we are talking about payments.
Mr. Mariusz, the state we are talking about here is also a huge employer.
It employs the entire public sphere, administration, teachers, services.
Should the state shape the level of earnings with the earnings it offers and pays?
We are dealing with the constant dissatisfaction of the public sphere.
They actually earn little.
Should the state give a good example and start paying more?
Today you have no mercy for me.
These are such useful stages and they should be rewarded in the same way as they contribute a lot to our social and economic life.
Once a teacher had, for example, high pensions and a high social status.
Today, there are failures going to school who can't do anything.
One in a hundred is suitable for this position when it comes to skills, qualifications and knowledge.
It's a shame to even comment on officials, because as usual, the example goes from the very top.
But as you can see, I vote for people, because I am voluntarily voting for people who could not manage a residential store, because they have no skills or economic knowledge.
When you look at literally the most important people in the country over the past decade and for decades,
I see a show of failures and failures of life without a shadow of professional achievements or professional knowledge, not to mention management or economy.
Recently, I saw that the marshal from the Sejm has a ""medium education"".
What kind of official should he have in the local government?
Should he be illiterate?
But they just set their own earnings and probably take care of it themselves to be at a good level.
No doubt, as we said about these officials, someone who doesn't know anything about something and is just an intermediary, has a lot better than those who supposedly have a name.
It's absurd.
If we hire someone professional, you can grumble that he earns a lot and so on, but at least he does his job well.
But when we have people who have no preparation, no education, no knowledge, no real achievements, and we give them super conditions, impunity, gigantic possibilities of earning money, legal and illegal, to be clear.
They also take various kinds of bribes, make gigantic scams, get into mafia systems.
This is a problem of the system, because we are not talking about the problems of specific people or specific parties.
The problem here is the whole system, the social and economic one.
The whole approach to it and how and what people we let into such positions, such responsible positions.
Mr. Marysiu, you have criticized the authorities a lot, but the fact is that in the last 5 years, the minimum wage, also criticized by you, has increased twice.
And somehow it has covered with a period of quite good prosperity.
So does the level of earnings affect the functioning of the economy?
I would not agree with your assumption that we had some prosperity in the last few years.
We are such a terribly debted country and in recent years the level of debt is rapidly increasing.
It's not that there is prosperity, sir. There is no prosperity.
I meant more the level of life of Poles, which has increased.
But that's exactly what I'm talking about.
This is not the level of life, it's just a higher level of debt.
We have no level of life. We have a minus level of life.
On the minus, see the official data, sejm.gov.pl, I encourage you to visit.
We are more and more in debt, it's getting worse.
Each successive government adds minuses to our balance sheet.
This is terrifying. The fact that someone will go to the casino, borrow money and buy you a lollipop, does not mean that you will live better in the family.
I'm sorry.
I'll eat a lollipop and be happy.
You see, literally, the father drinks, everything is set up in the casino, and he goes to his wife to buy flowers, a child a lollipop.
""I'm a great father, look, I can handle it.""
Someone will pay this debt.
And I say right away, it will definitely not be a politician.
It will definitely not be an official, ladies and gentlemen.
You will pay this debt, and see what the average debt for every Pole looks like.
These are terrifying amounts.
You are a part of this country, and you are burdened with the appropriate part of this debt, which is borne by an official and a politician in your name.
Finally, Mr. Mariusz, I would like to ask about another difficult topic, i.e. the availability of rewards.
The European Union is preparing, or rather has already prepared, regulations that will require the increase of this availability.
For example, private companies, not to mention any public institutions, will soon announce the level of rewards.
Maybe not for a specific person, but let's say for a given position.
And in theory, this is supposed to lead to a balance of payments, to eliminate any inequalities,
for example, that men earn more than women doing the same job.
Can these things be regulated so abhorrently by the regulations, or will it always be born in some pathology?
It can definitely be regulated, and all communist governments have always done it.
Of course, it is also as you said, that despite the formal regulation, people will do their own, and entrepreneurs and employees.
That is why every communist is based on lies.
Officially there is one narrative, but in reality there is a gap between what is said and what is done.
It's always bad, ladies and gentlemen.
The third aspect of your question is even more serious.
The complete absurdity of the very idea of this idea, that someone will be equal to the employee.
One day we can do an audition on how women earn, how men earn.
Because this is an amazing topic, and I think it is a rather broad topic.
Ideologically, not economically.
So maybe we will look not from the point of view of ideology, but from the point of view of economy.
Mr. Mariusz, answering my question, you have opened a whole range of new questions, and there are so many of them that we will definitely not make it in time for this audition.
Thank you very much for the interview, I hope it was interesting.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Quite recently you complained about the citizens of Ukraine,
who quickly get a license to retire in Poland.
Meanwhile, I recently saw an interview with the president of ZUS.
She revealed that it is thanks to millions of foreigners,
of which probably 750,000 are Ukrainians,
foreigners who pay pensions and health insurance in Poland,
the situation in the Social Security Fund is stable.
So in practice, no one from the pensions has to worry
that they will not get a pension in time and that there will be any problems with the payment of pensions.
So maybe the benefits of hiring Ukrainians are greater than losses.
Anyway, I don't even know how many pensions we pay for Ukrainians and what the amounts are,
because I have never found such data anywhere.
You probably won't find them easily.
No one would be in your hands if you could find them so easily.
Let's say you have financial problems and you can't afford the payments.
What now? What now?
I'll take a momentary loan and suddenly everything goes as it should.
It's cool, because nothing works for you, right?
Well, not really, I guess.
Well, because then you have to pay that moment.
Bravo.
That's the problem, that it's not just one problem.
Number one, it's enough for you to tap on TikTok, YouTube
and see Ukrainians who teach other Ukrainians how to get pensions from Poland.
And we're not talking about persuading them to work until they're 60,
but saying ""no, no, no, no, no one says that and they don't plan it that way"".
Of course, if you check the average Polish pension,
it's not very high, but in Ukraine such a pension is PLN 250-270,
so it doesn't matter how much they get in the Polish pension system,
for them it's just an amazing luxury, which they will have paid for the rest of their lives.
I quickly checked the economic status of Ukrainians in Poland.
The Economic Cooperation and Development Organization calculated in its report
that Poland has spent the most money from all countries
on covering the costs of supporting Ukrainians, the so-called ""pensioners"".
Let's be honest, we pay as much as all the countries together.
For 10 months of 2022 we spent PLN 40 billion.
I think that Ukrainians in taxes or ZUS etc. paid any noticeable amount,
let's say, I'm not exaggerating, it's completely noticeable, their impact on our economy.
But the impact is very measurable, very noticeable.
So even this already destroys any sense that Ukrainians are in Poland at all,
in any amount, to be honest.
I read in this report that, I quote,
""Ukrainian citizens living in Poland send to their country on average PLN 771 per month.""
Per person, right?
Yes. This is evidenced by research conducted by the Migration Platform
and the University of Warsaw's study.
More than half of Ukrainians declare that they send money to Poland,
and only 6% receive it.
So we finance 94% of their lives, not only their lives,
but also their families, their businesses, their money in Ukraine.
When I saw the questionnaire of research conducted by the Migration Platform,
Ukrainians receive on average PLN 961 per month
after all the expenses related to Poland.
The Border Guard, since February 2022, recorded 15.5 million entries to Poland from Ukraine.
15.5 million entries!
Officially, I took from the government data,
that 328,000 Ukrainian children use the 500+.
You can guess that the number of mothers must be significantly smaller than the number of children.
Let's round it up, let it be a crazy half a million mothers with children.
15.5 million entries, and half a million are only mothers with children.
So who entered us?
You said that maybe it is beneficial for us, for the ZUS.
Let's take a look at ZUS.
ZUS is bankrupt.
We have to pay about PLN 300 billion in the next years from the budget to pay for the certificates.
So ZUS is not able to finance itself from what it receives.
And we are talking about a gigantic disparity in what it needs and what it receives.
Do you remember the moment when there was such a big hole,
that they took every Ukrainian, so that they worked for a moment,
there will be some payment, and they will make payments from it.
But despite this, we still have to pay the budget.
ZUS is bankrupt, it is evident.
Is ZUS bankrupt?
Obviously not.
Because according to the Constitution, not ZUS, but the Polish government is responsible for the payments.
The whole of Poland would have to officially announce bankruptcy,
so that ZUS could go bankrupt.
That's why you can steal ZUS as much as you want,
because it will always be added as much as necessary,
so that this system works.
Of course, from the pockets of taxpayers, i.e. ours.
I will give you a word, but if we have a wave of emigrants who work now,
and there are several hundred thousand people,
some of them may stay permanently in Poland.
They will not support this pension system in any significant way, staying here?
If our pension system is inefficient in the current system,
when a Pole works until the age of 60,
then if we add people who will not work as much,
so they will invest much less.
Money circulates in the economy like blood,
and it feeds individual organs, individual industries, individual companies.
And suddenly, someone will let go of this blood,
and this blood will flow elsewhere, abroad.
The same is with markets, with Western companies that do not pay taxes here,
and they take profits for themselves.
They just cut our veins and pump out Polish blood, Polish money.
Do you understand? Ukrainians do exactly the same.
We are talking about millions of people who do this.
ZUS itself is an inefficient organ at many levels.
I will give you a quote from the portal many.pl.
""The Supreme Court has suspended two years of prison for Sylwester R.
former president of the Social Security Foundation
and Tadeusz R. former director of the ZUS branch of the Szczecin University.
Millions of zlotys spent on levy of sick leave.""
And so on and so forth.
Our money is not in good hands.
The system is inefficient on its own,
and people who work in the system
brutally use it and deteriorate the whole system.
And Ukrainians do even worse things.
A lot of examples that the media does not write about at all, which shocks me.
Stealing Polish VAT system by Ukrainians.
CBA.gov.pl portal.
A citizen of Ukraine was to withdraw VAT tax on the border.
The detention has to do with the withdrawal of VAT tax
returned on the borders as part of tax-free
and a capture for the guards.
The documents were for a total amount of PLN 200,000.
The charges were heard by 40 people,
and the services are planning further detention.
To sum up, we are talking about a great Ukrainian mafia
massively extorting VAT taxes.
In short, money from our budget, from the state's pocket.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
In the Republic of Poland, for example.
I quote.
""Companies cooperating with entities supporting the victims of war
do not pay and will not pay VAT for tax-free goods and services.""
""The condition for applying a zero rate is the content of a written contract
of an entrepreneur with one of the above-mentioned entities.
It should result that tax-free goods or services
are associated with the help of the injured.""
What's interesting, there is no control system
in Ukraine about what's going on with these goods.
How are we supposed to control them in a foreign country,
especially one so corrupt, and during the war?
So let's guess what's going on with Polish money.
Because we physically spend, pay VAT to them.
I myself saw in my own eyes Ukrainians
who buy products in Poland,
declare that they are being exported abroad,
get VAT money, and in Poland they sell them,
for example, on OLIX, Allegro, and so on.
I'm not saying that all Ukrainians steal VAT from us,
because not everyone is such a fan,
but we say that each of them can do it.
Because there is no control over it,
no one controls it, because who would?
You should try to do something like that.
You won't do it, why? Because you don't deserve it.
That's the whole joke.
There is nothing I could imagine economically
that could compensate us for the gigantic losses we are suffering,
for which you and your children will pay.
There is no other option.
To make it even better.
We are good, we help the poor, oppressed, and the attacked.
But unfortunately, it's not like that.
I took the data from the US Congress,
where serious debates are taking place,
because the Americans have already realized
that Ukrainians are not able to pay off
hundreds of billions of dollars that were sent there.
And they are not able to pay it off in an absurdly scandalous way.
And the US secret services
were not able to reveal to the press
the corruption scandals in the nearest area of Zelenski.
Because they didn't react to the notes they were sent,
that ""do something with this theft, with the catchers, with the swindlers"".
Because it's on a large scale.
The aid that is coming, the goods, which I also say,
zero watts, which are coming from Poland,
you have no control over what will happen.
And we know for sure that it lands on the black market,
in the hands of the mafiosos who trade it.
And we pump that money there
in tens, or maybe hundreds of billions.
It can't be a good interest, to put it shortly.
Mr. Mariusz, time for a break.
After the break, we'll come back to the topic of the pension system.
Pension system
Pension system
What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
We started with the topic of pensions
and I hope we'll finish our hearing on the topic of pensions.
Mr. Mariusz, it wasn't us who invented the current pension system,
based on the so-called ""pension solidarity"",
i.e. a system that means that
employees are paying pensions
for those who use these pensions.
This system used to work.
Does it make no sense at all now
and it needs to be thoroughly reformed?
Is it enough to fix it?
The slogan itself, the idea itself, makes sense,
but of course not its implementation.
Everything is in communist ideologies.
It sounds beautiful, but in practice it doesn't work at all.
It's like you want to fix a corpse.
Someone who dies is in a carriage state.
You can, of course, you can do everything
and it's probably appropriate to do everything,
but you have to think about what will happen when this corpse dies.
We have to somehow continue to exist.
I will say this, in the current system I can't imagine
the existence of such a system,
which is not able to sustain itself,
which, as you say, is a ""reversed pyramid"",
because that's exactly what it looks like.
It has no future,
which is still overused, as I have already shown
in a few examples, in a scandalous way,
both internally and externally.
Maybe let's let it die.
Mr. Mariusz, but maybe the solution in this situation
and after such a solution has already been reached in the past
is to extend the retirement age.
If we work until the age of 70
and then live for a few years only,
then these financial proportions will reverse.
I know you're not a politician,
so I'm asking you as an economist,
what is your opinion on this matter?
Of course, you're right, as an economist
I am definitely in favor of such a model,
that you work until, let's say,
96 years old,
because it gives a guarantee that the system will be stable.
And maybe even on the plus side,
because the data I have
guarantees that almost no one will take out a pension.
Finally, this system will fix you.
Economically, it's a good idea.
You will pay all your life,
work until the day of your death
and that's it. Thank you.
Then the advisors will ask what about our deposits,
where did the money go, since we don't use them?
There are many people willing to take these deposits.
And there is no problem with the deposits.
They will be used.
The government, officials and politicians
can take care of your money perfectly,
they will prove it and they will probably prove it for the next years.
There is also a solution based on the so-called social pension.
So we work and we all get the same,
very low pension,
let's say, 2,000 zlotys in today's realities.
Everyone gets the same amount,
regardless of how much they worked,
how much they deposited. Is this a good solution?
It sounds like a communist ideal.
Everyone is equal.
From an economic point of view, you know how it will be.
If you get the same amount,
regardless of how much work you put in,
every single person will put in as little work as possible.
So if everyone put in less and less work,
it turns out that there is no one
who would have to work out even the minimum amount.
So we enter another spiral of absurdity,
which will show us that the less you work,
the less you try,
the less positive things you do for the economy,
the better for you.
The assumption system is designed to destroy in such a system.
There is no free market mechanism,
that the more you work,
the better you live and your children.
It's okay, I encourage you to work.
But if you have a company and work more,
we will give the money to those who do not work.
As part of various reforms of the pension system in Poland,
several years ago, the so-called second and third pillars of retirement were introduced.
So theoretically and practically,
we have the opportunity to deposit
some money in individual accounts
for the rest of our lives
and add a second part of the pension in the future.
Data show that from such individual pension accounts
800,000 people have used so far.
A very small percentage, because 15 million people work in Poland.
Why are such individual accounts not popular?
Because Poles are not as naive as it might seem.
They are stuck at so many levels for so many years and so many governments
that they finally realized that if the government launches something,
they usually lose it in the end.
Although most Poles, from what I suspect,
have no idea how the whole system works,
whether IKEA or ZUS,
they intuitively know from experience
that this is another trap for their money.
Poles started to deposit money
on various types of accounts,
investment funds,
and here they fell into another trap,
because they fell into the arms of scammers
and they simply beat them mercilessly.
So this is not a good solution either, right?
While the idea itself is very cool,
the trick is whether it is implemented
properly, intelligently and in accordance with the laws of the economy.
The idea of ​​investing your money,
which you develop, is brilliant,
but when it is realized,
I will give you an example again.
You have a sum of money for your shopping
in a month and you took some neighbor
and said, ""Okay, listen, you will do these shopping for me,
because I don't have time, I will take care of my business,
my things, and you do such shopping for me,
because I know what I need, okay, go buy.""
And everything works until you suddenly look,
""Wait a minute, but he's buying me
low-quality, cheap products,
which are much more expensive than what I know
what they should cost.
Does the neighbor care
that I have the cheapest and best quality products?
What does he care about?
Well, that he's fine.
For example, he will get a commission from some store
where he will do shopping for you,
for your money, for you.
Yes, it's more expensive, yes, the products are worse,
but you know, I'll give you 10% of what you spend.
And you think this system will work well for you,
or bad for you?
In general, they can manage absurdly badly,
the majority manages absurdly badly with this money,
and they are doing great anyway.
Well, because it's nobody's money,
nobody cares about it.
You can take this neighbor for a snack,
shake him twice,
give the thief money back,
and the calories cost not so much, but so much,
and the milk not so much, but so much.
But you won't go to investment funds anyway,
because you don't even have anyone to talk to.
That's why this is an absurd implementation.
If you did it commercially,
that is, you choose such a company,
and listen, I don't like how you start to sleep with money,
you have too little profit, you can't do it,
I'm taking your money, get out.
I would start to care about having a client.
And now people signed up for these funds,
I don't know if you remember,
it was a scandalous action in my opinion.
People put ads on TV,
people put these pillars on the basis of advertising,
that some cool actor performed,
or a pretty girl,
or some funny password,
and people put money there for their whole life,
for their whole future.
So don't be surprised that it has no right to work.
Mr. Mariusz, we are finishing the topic of pensions
in the third part of our audition,
I invite you to take a break.
PARROT TV
PARROT TV
What is the game, Mr. Mariusz?
Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, economic and financial expert,
today answers questions about the pension system
and not only.
Mr. Mariusz, each of us should think
about what will happen in a few years,
when he will be old,
he will not be able to support himself,
how to provide a decent pension.
A politician said
that he invests in children,
has a lot of them and is not worried about his future.
He said very wisely,
only that most people will think
it's another 500 or 800 plus.
If we talk about investing in children,
it is very wise, we invest in their education,
for example, economic education, ladies and gentlemen.
If you want to invest money the best,
I will quote one of the billionaires,
who said that the best investment
is an investment in yourself.
Do you know what billionaires do?
I don't know, but I would love to find out.
Most of the day they spend on
learning, on reading.
They minimize the number of meetings,
the number of their direct involvement
in business,
that's why they hire people
to pay the best experts.
But three quarters of their day
they spend on themselves,
on their children,
to educate them,
to prepare them for managing money
and running a business.
This is a profit.
This is the difference between
the rich elite and the poor plebs.
The biggest business
you can make money on
is yourself, your knowledge, your skills.
That's why, ladies and gentlemen,
the best thing we can do
is to invest in our own economic knowledge,
in our future.
And, among other things,
me and the editor created this portal,
audycikon.pl.
I will be honest, I spent some time
and developed a small system
that will allow you to easily
and, best of all,
free of charge, if you follow my guide,
which I have developed for you,
to increase your economic knowledge
and to educate your children.
And this is how you build your future, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's act like billionaires.
Let's invest in our economic knowledge.
A week ago we were talking about earnings.
You said then that the worth of
the payment in Poland
should be several thousand zlotys.
I reached for the statistics.
Last year, the average pension
was 3,500 zlotys
for men.
For women, much less,
2400 zlotys.
And in agriculture, the average pension
paid from a separate money,
from a Krus, is even less
than 2000 zlotys.
This is very far from the decent standard of living.
How do the pensioners cope
in such situations?
They are vegetating. The only solution.
Of course, we did not say about it either.
All the analyses I have done
lead to one, only one conclusion.
There will be a significant
reduction
in the payment of pensions in Poland,
because the amount of life
is increased, because we have inflation,
the amount of money in the ZUS,
in the whole system, is rapidly decreasing,
because it is a leaking system,
as we have already shown at several levels.
Therefore, the only solution is
to reduce the payments.
We will, ladies and gentlemen, have a generation
of starving,
hard-working people,
who will have to choose between
food and medicine.
Because only when people
get used to this wall,
they will be refreshed.
It is not a problem in money,
in the system, etc.
The problem is in us, in our ignorance,
inability to choose,
to manage our money.
If we will still believe
that some politician will come,
guru, who will take care of it,
then every time we will be robbed
in the next Amber Gold, in the next government,
which will only be famous for
the fact that more scandals are brewing,
and so on.
If you don't understand this,
you will have stronger and stronger signals.
Until you finally wake up and say,
""Oh, damn it, enough of this.""
The problem is that you support communism
and you think that if communism changes
its slogan a little, it will suddenly become good.
Communism always leads to one thing -
poverty, despair and millions of deaths.
Maybe it's time
when these retirees start dying of hunger,
when companies are massively bankrupt,
when they are burdened with absurd ZUS payments
and tax payments,
where others are withdrawing gigantic amounts of money
without any ZUS, without any VAT.
Maybe this is the moment
when it is worth waking up
and saying,
""I think we're doing something wrong.""
Mr. Mariusz, there are some countries in the world,
I am talking about developed countries,
at least at the level of Poland,
which have a normal, healthy pension system,
which simply does not require
constant budgeting with more and more money.
Where to look for an example?
From what I know,
most countries in the world do not have
such a system, at all, a pension system.
And those who have it,
practically have this system in the majority
ineffective.
Because it is, as I said,
a communist idea.
This is the whole idea based on
forced social equality,
which practically
can never work properly.
And certainly not because
some wonderful government
discourages work,
discourages activity,
discourages honesty.
In Poland, as far as I remember,
almost 1.5 million people get money
in full or in part
outside the contract, outside the ZUS,
i.e. the so-called ""basement"".
They stick to social solidarity.
Because they understand
that this is stupid, this is unfair,
this is ineffective.
They don't help their grandmother,
they help greedy entrepreneurs
of the Ukrainian mafia,
greedy officials who make
scams, catch-ups, etc.
They enrich them, but certainly not
their grandmother, the old woman.
Mr. Mariusz, but one note to all this.
Indeed, it used to work without the participation
of the state, but then the average age was
60 or about 60 years.
Now, in the case of women, even above 80.
So this state care
somehow transferred to a longer life.
Not quite state care
has been transferred to a longer life.
For example, mobilization,
increasing awareness,
at least in the field of ordinary hygiene,
in the field of prevention, in the field of development
of technology, medicine.
This has extended our lives significantly.
These people should
really find a new place
in society, but it's hard for me to imagine
forcing an 80-year-old
to a professional activity.
Maybe you just
have to do the other way.
Just like it was for centuries.
They served super important social functions
as advisors to the tax,
to life, etc. They were just such coaches.
This man could
save your property and life.
That's why it was worth
giving him this bowl of soup and this stove
to keep this man.
It's completely different than telling him to work.
I can't imagine something like that.
It's an absurd idea.
Thank you very much for the hearing,
for the conversation, Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, and our listeners.
We encourage you to
visit www.audycje.com.pl
on the website.
There is much more to know.
Thank you for your attention.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we're going to talk about the current topic of the protests of drivers on the Polish-Ukrainian border.
A few months ago, we talked about the protests of farmers against cheap agricultural products that came to us from Ukraine.
And the situation is back to square one.
For months, Polish transport companies have been protesting on the eastern border.
They simply cannot stand the competition with the cheaper services of Ukrainian carriers.
These carriers themselves have prepared a set that results from the fact that on the Polish side,
when ordering goods in a Polish company, someone has to pay at least 1 euro and 10 eurocents for every kilometer traveled.
And if the same service is ordered by a Ukrainian carrier, he will only pay 60 eurocents.
Almost half less.
Mr. Mariusz, where does it come from?
Well, from the fact that Ukraine is better off with two of its borders.
Twice as much, more precisely, than Poland.
And as you can see, the war serves the Ukrainians.
Evidently, in every field, not only do they get hundreds of billions of dollars in aid,
the Union still keeps several million of their citizens.
I remind you, they were leaving during the biggest pandemic, where Poles could not visit cemeteries for a long time.
And at that moment, millions of Ukrainians arrived and a miracle happened.
The number of hostilities began to decrease and people stopped dying in a wonderful way.
Ukraine is a wonderful country, sir.
And maybe we should move all our businesses there.
Let's start with the first factors, Mr. Mariusz.
What does it mean that Ukraine cares more about its companies?
Do they pay less taxes there? Do they have less problems with the office management of their business?
Definitely. Practically, running a Ukrainian company, you have to deal with almost one single thing.
This one single thing is the cash.
If you only manage this, you run a company in Ukraine without any problems, without any controls,
without any penalties, without any state intervention.
Well, just a fairy tale.
But the cash is an additional cost that the entrepreneur has to pay, right?
And it's mandatory. Instead of having 15 types of taxes here, you have one.
Cash is the foundation of operating in Ukraine, in the Ukrainian business.
It's hard to explain to someone who doesn't run an interest there or doesn't know well someone who runs an interest in Ukraine,
to understand how different it is.
It's exactly the opposite of what you would have on the other side of the border, for example in Poland.
It's infinitely easier to run a company in Ukraine.
And so far, the Ukrainians have not destroyed our transport company for very specific reasons.
Because they couldn't.
But not because everything was magically more expensive then.
No, it was even cheaper than it is now.
There were transport limits.
When entering the territory of the Polish European Union, Ukrainian companies had to obtain a permit.
And the number of these permits was strictly limited.
Now it's not mandatory.
So they drive as much as they want, as much as they can.
And this decision was made by the European Commission, not by the Polish government.
So actually, the postulates of Polish transport companies are directed there.
For me, you know, the whole narrative on two levels I don't like.
First, the limits.
You know what I think about such communist inventions.
How do the limits work?
They only create a gray zone of crime and so on.
How did the mafia in the United States come into being, which they still can't shake off?
By introducing prohibitions.
You introduce limits to anything and you have organized crime.
Greatly financed, because that's what big money is made of, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Marysiu, but it is precisely the people who protest on the border who demand the limits.
These Polish entrepreneurs.
Because these people, sir, are drivers.
What can they understand from the economy, macroeconomics, the economy of enterprises?
Well, each of them runs a small business, so they should basically learn.
I have been advising companies for over 20 years.
I am professional in this.
I have also advised transport companies for many years, sir.
And I've gone through a bit of these companies in my life.
So I had the opportunity to get into their specifics.
Their profits, losses, how this business is run.
That's why you know, these people are simply not economists.
They are not analysts.
They are not strategists in terms of sales or marketing activities.
Because they are supposed to know what they are doing.
On transport.
They don't know what economists know, sir.
That's why they don't understand what they demand.
Exactly, Mr. Marysiu, what can you advise them in a situation when they basically have no chance in competition with a cheaper opponent?
Well, just one thing.
Start thinking where the problem is.
Do you know where the problem is?
That they don't know where the problem is.
That's where the real problem is.
I suspect that it concerns the majority of Poles.
Now they complain about the EU and all that.
What a complete nonsense.
The Polish government decides and approves everything.
The Polish government is not subject to the EU.
It is a sovereign country that can make sovereign decisions.
We don't need to beg anyone here.
Or even consult anyone, really.
Just look at Hungary, for example.
What, Hungary is not in the EU?
They do what they want in their country.
And what happened to them? Nothing.
So, if there is no problem in the EU...
In the Polish government.
Not in the Polish government.
In the Polish citizens, sir.
Because it is they who elect politicians who elect the Polish government, sir.
And those who protest and many other protesters who will protest, because it will be very, very bad, it will be worse and worse in the Polish economy, which I have been repeating to you for a long time.
The problem is in the lack of economic knowledge.
Poles. Where were those protesters?
Farmers, carriers, miners.
Where were they during the elections?
Why didn't they ask questions?
And what is your economic program for these, for these and for these?
Because they can't ask these questions, because they don't understand how the economy works.
And then, of course, people come to power who say what people want to hear by voting.
They don't talk about the economy at all.
And if they do, it's such cosmic nonsense that I just want to cry.
Let them all go bankrupt.
Which is inevitable.
Because already in the transport industry, the margins on which they were driving were really small.
Because again, this beloved Union, which everyone in the Gremialny supported, so that we could enter, the Union would be great, we would get money.
Wow, what money.
And Poland is paying gigantic money to be in the so-called Union.
And people who are not aware of how the Union works will be talking nonsense.
This is the essence of ignorance.
This is, you know, terrible for me.
That's why these things are not terrible, some companies will go bankrupt and so on.
It doesn't really matter.
It's even very good.
Because as I said and I will repeat today, the more people get hit in the back, the greater the chance that they will start thinking,
""Something is probably wrong in this country.""
But what is wrong?
Well, we are wrong, ladies and gentlemen.
This problem is in us.
Not in some magical, evil, EU government.
Not in our evil government, one after another.
I'm not saying, since the war, I really don't know, apart from the Polish government, any government that had any economic movements,
which were coordinated, logical, wise and pro-Polish.
People don't understand that politics is actually a different variety of the word ""economy"".
That's why the problem lies here, not in those protesting there, the boss, the driver, or whoever else is protesting there, or the farmers.
Mrs. Mariusz, let's go back to the protesting farmers in a moment.
Now, I invite you to a break.
The end
The end
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mariusz, Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Today we are discussing the current topic, the protests of drivers on the Polish-Ukrainian border.
A few days ago I was listening to the talks, or rather the explanations, that the Deputy Minister of Transport was giving to the entrepreneurs.
And he said that the decision to limit the limits, i.e. to let in Ukrainian companies without any problems in the EU,
did not fall under the control of the Polish government, that it is a decision of the European Commission and there is no sign of any Polish minister there.
This actually indicates that, in a sense, we have already lost this economic and economic sovereignty.
In that case, if the transport entrepreneurs protested in Brussels and blocked Brussels, could the effect of this protest be greater?
Zero.
Well, if the farmers protested in France a few or a dozen years ago, they achieved something.
But if you look at the history of France's presence in the EU, you will see the incredible privileges that France and French citizens,
and French farmers in particular, because I will give you a specific example that I know.
Poland is doing quite well in the milk industry.
I had an insight, from my professional points of view, into Polish and French milk producers.
And what the French can do, compared to what the Polish can do, is just like a Polish and Ukrainian carrier.
In Poland, you just have to have a pharmacy in the camp, incredible controls, and so on, terrible penalties.
There, you can practically do it in practically any conditions.
This is complete inequality.
If you believe that in EU countries there are the same ethical regulations, that is, there is no green concept of the operation of the European Union and EU regulations.
I am speaking here from the position of an expert on the European funds.
The guidelines are going from the top, but the implementation of these regulations already depends on the governments.
One regulation comes out, for example, the control of European projects.
In Great Britain, you put it all together on one document, on one sheet, literally once.
In Poland, you have 30 documents and you have several controls and a whole bunch of officials who will explain you in all possible ways.
We introduce it ourselves, because I know that governments like to explain, ""Oh, it's this bad EU.""
So why when you go to France or Great Britain, I see completely different regulations and a completely different implementation of the same guidelines,
because in fact the EU has no right to give rights in the state.
This is a national right over EU law, ladies and gentlemen.
To make it clear.
That's why Ukrainians have it much easier, apart from the fact that they have everything. Smaller, cheaper, less formalities, as I said, just a few bucks and you have practically everything.
That's why if a Pole runs this business, he will earn much less on it.
Tens of percent less, where there are no such marches as before.
Now some people ride literally on a few percent marches, where they have millions of dollars worth of equipment sometimes.
But if you can have a pretty bad technical condition of cars, you can reload them freely, which is a great gain.
But in our country, if they catch you, you are literally destroyed.
The penalties are sometimes terrible.
Ukrainians won't do anything to him, because first of all, no one will control him.
In their country, these penalties are not.
Let's face it, it's a catch for a guard of a few dollars, and drivers who leave have these dollars.
So for them, no penalty, no mandate does not exist.
You ask how much do Polish and Ukrainian drivers get on average?
Ukrainian drivers simply do not get a mandate, because in Ukraine you can't get a mandate, sir.
Polish protesters, transport workers, because let's get back to this topic, some of the postulates are directed, surprisingly, to the Ukrainian government.
And I don't know if their implementation can be expected at all.
For example, a simple matter, that the trucks that return from Ukraine, Polish trucks, return empty, without goods.
They didn't have to stand in queues, they didn't have to register in some queue systems, they didn't have to wait even a week longer, just to return to their country.
What's the point? Why such a simple postulate has not been possible to arrange so far, and some protest is needed, an outbreak for this reason.
I don't know if the protest broke out for this reason.
It seems to me that they were more hurt by the fact that they didn't stand in queues.
I think it's about money.
So, falling profits, right? From this activity, basically.
The threat of bankruptcy.
We are not talking about the fact that they will lose some profits.
It's like you were supposed to race.
You stand in a row and you have to run.
And suddenly someone loads a 20-pound bag on your back, and around it he distributes some energy-supporting bars.
What do you think about it?
These are not equal conditions of competition, for sure.
In my opinion, you are taking it too gently.
It's not about equal conditions of competition, it's just crushing one side and boosting the other.
Because you don't have a chance to run, because in a moment your legs will bend under your head and you will just fall over.
It's just impossible.
In the most normal world, there is no point in competing in such an event.
And exactly Polish truckers are in this situation.
They have a lot of financial, formal and legal burdens, which Ukrainians don't have.
Our people will literally fall on their faces, there will be total plight.
I checked it out, and before the war 160,000 trucks were brought to Poland every year.
Today, a million trucks are coming from Ukraine.
How come that on our border, the Polish border, in the east, as a result of protests,
sometimes you have to wait for a week and Ukrainians complain about it?
In a situation where waiting for 10 or even a dozen days is a norm on the Ukrainian border,
at least that's what our drivers say, is that proof that the Ukrainian state is inoperative and can't organize the work,
so that it can be done efficiently?
No, of course it's nonsense.
Ukrainian customs services are excellent, they are one of the best in the world.
You can drive through any Ukrainian border in a few minutes, you give a hand and you go.
A person I know was driving through the Ukrainian border with a businessman.
They drove through without even stopping, they just drove through.
The customs officers knew that at this time such a car was to pass,
and they just all turned their eyes away, raised their eyes and that's what happened.
This is what a passage through the Ukrainian border looks like in practice.
Who is to go, will go.
And the same with the smuggling, because it is not said at all that this is one of the main gates of smuggling, mass smuggling.
And these are things that you only see in the news from America or in some sensational movies.
There is a massive, scandalous, gigantic smuggling going on.
You get a package for a truck, you get X money from a person you don't know,
you drive through, you have no problems at the border, everything goes smoothly.
I don't know what's there, I don't even know if these people know what they're transporting there,
but they certainly don't transport toys for children or help for refugees.
I don't know what's going on now, alcohol, cigarettes,
but I assume that, as in the whole world, weapons, drugs, prisoners, to brothels in Nience.
Read the statistics, see from the police actions when they reveal it.
It's all over Poland.
These paroled girls have to be in these trucks, in these cars.
Ukraine is a totally corrupt state, ruled by the mafia and oligarchs,
who elect governments, including the currently ruling president of Ukraine,
who was chosen and fully financed by an oligarch, one of the richest people in Ukraine.
We are told some fairy tale that Ukrainians are wonderful, wonderful people who fight for our freedom,
who die for us.
I'm not talking about facts, documented, confirmed for decades, known facts.
The Ukrainian mafia is one of the worst mafias in the world,
that's why the truck drivers and the transport companies are second and third bottom, sir.
Mr. Mariusz, break, we're coming back to the subject after the break.
The end
The end
Good morning, Mr. Mariusz, Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist.
Today we're talking about what's really going on in the protest of Polish truck drivers on the eastern border.
However, the addressee of their claims is also the Polish authorities.
The drivers demand retorsy, which is the use of similar difficulties
that Polish drivers face in Ukraine,
against Ukrainian transport companies that come to Poland.
Is it a good way to balance the competition between these two sides?
No, of course not.
First of all, the Polish government can't do anything to the Ukrainian government.
We are in a service position here, not a partner position.
Take a look at all the decisions made so far related to Polish-Ukrainian relations.
We're pouring tens of billions of help there, destroying our own hotels,
destroying our own budget, destroying our own economic sectors.
And now you expect the same government to suddenly let in 15.5 million people.
And now you think that suddenly, magically, it will all turn around?
Theoretically, if we started to add and impose additional requirements,
control over Ukrainian transport companies in Poland,
well, maybe it would discourage them.
Let's try. Thought experiment. You want to control a million vehicles.
I have a year for that, because you gave the annual data.
We have the road transport inspection, we have the road police.
You are not able to control a million travels.
You are not even able to control 100,000.
You choose to stop Ukrainian companies and control them.
It is impossible.
We can't do anything in this position.
That's why it's bad that people think that now, when they're doing their own thing,
something will change. No, it won't change.
Because it's not a problem, sir, that these Ukrainians don't follow the rules.
Or that they have lower costs. It's not a problem.
After the protests of farmers, after the protests of the transport industry, who will be next?
Who will the competition with Ukraine touch to the point that it will go out on the street and start protest actions?
According to my knowledge, exactly everyone. In every aspect, Ukrainians crush Poles.
Whether it will be the home economy, whether it will be business management,
whether it will be possible to transport goods, buy tax-free,
for example, what Ukrainians do, or even employment.
This is one reason, but reason number two is at least as strong as not stronger.
Because, ladies and gentlemen, remember that the economy is not a net of selected businessmen,
who work there independently.
It's like a human bloodstream.
Money in the country is like blood in a human body.
If you start cutting his veins at different ends,
the fact that he will cut your left hand will damage your whole body.
Well, unfortunately, there is little blood in the whole body.
No matter where I stab this knife, you will suffer for this reason,
you will bleed to death.
No matter if it's a tiny finger at your leg, you'll die.
Blood circulates in the whole body, ladies and gentlemen.
And we are bleeding like a pig.
These knives are stabbed into successive sections.
Farmers, transport workers, blow after blow.
They cry, protest, complain.
I hope I showed you today that they don't understand what they demand,
and they don't understand what they protest against.
And this is their problem.
By the way, ours too, because we are also in this bloodstream, ladies and gentlemen.
We will also die when the transport workers die, when the farmers die.
We will also die.
If we don't all educate ourselves economically, on a large scale, we will die.
I invite you to such an audition, to listen to the curiosities from the world.
You are currently investing in saving your life, your children, their future and your country.
Through economic education.
We had it in history.
We were brutally Germanized.
And what did the Poles do?
Once, after the next uprising, where we were murdered, crushed by the occupation army,
a slogan was created - Poles, let's hold the ground, Poles, build me a company, build your property,
build companies, build businesses, build pro-party behavior.
Because this is the Polish blood.
Because thanks to this, your children will speak Polish.
You won't be parodies of some Germans or Muscovites.
I respect you for being here and listening to this audition,
because this is how you save yourself and your children, but also expand this knowledge.
I am not able to save anything, because the fact that I know something more or less,
I understand, unfortunately, does not help Poland.
Only when my level of knowledge will have a million people, then everything will become simple.
I don't think I have any brilliant, wonderful or secret knowledge.
I am such a typical Pole.
It is up to you to educate yourself, your family, your friends,
and then, ladies and gentlemen, all these problems will disappear like a magic wand.
And with this very positive message, Mr. Mariusz, we will come to the end of today's audition.
Thank you very much for the interview.
Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist, our expert.
And we invite you to the Internet, to our website audycje.com.pl,
where you can listen to this audition again in its full version
and you can find a lot of other interesting materials.
Thank you, Krzysztof Strauchman.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What's up with artificial intelligence?
Today we're talking about it with Mariusz Stefaniak,
our expert,
financial expert, economist,
a man renowned in the world of economy.
I heard, or actually read,
that in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre
artificial intelligence wrote a local law,
specifically a law
on water meters
that the councilors couldn't come up with.
One of the city councilors
gave this task to the GTP chat.
The general idea was to make
the local water supply plant
obligatory to install new water meters
quickly, because there's a plague
with water meter thefts in this city.
Artificial intelligence
proposed a regulation that
water meters have 30 days to install
new water meters,
because if they don't,
they simply can't collect
the water fees.
Brilliant and simple, Mr. Mariusz.
Why didn't the man come up with it?
In one sentence I'll explain to you
that these are completely different worlds
with different activities and goals.
In one, it's like this.
Artificial intelligence
is not any intelligence,
but advanced,
self-learning mathematical models
designed to search
for optimal results
in the shortest time.
On the other hand,
the activity of the city councils
is the exact opposite.
It's about increasing the degree of complexity,
extending the time and costs of the activity.
Political or official activities
have completely opposite effects
than one would expect
from logically thinking people.
And this example with water meters
is so interesting,
that maybe it would be a good idea
to ask ourselves why
there is such a problem at all?
Why don't we have such mass thieves?
Why? Because there is a fatal government,
a fatal economy,
people are poor,
politicians are corrupt
and no artificial intelligence
can fix anything.
So it was easier for us
to invent artificial intelligence
than to reprogram the way
the administration, offices and politicians act, right?
Yes, exactly. You are right.
It's easier to generate the most advanced
self-learning models
than to elect honest politicians.
Mr. Mariusz, but this resolution
in the city of Porto Alegre was approved
by the City Council and only then,
after this fact, the councilor
who asked for the proposal
for artificial intelligence,
publicly said that it was
the city council that prepared the draft of this resolution.
Does it mean that we are ashamed
to use artificial intelligence
in our politics?
No, it depends on who and how
uses it. Artificial intelligence is just a tool.
New, efficient, if they can use it, let's add.
In the past, computers,
calculation arcs
or text editors were a leap.
Until now, computers have been giving us
a boring, laborious job,
and now they are starting to give us
a creative job.
It is a bit of a shame, at least for some.
No, no, I will not agree with that.
There have been a lot of such loud cases,
of uneducated or lazy lawyers
or programmers using AI
or SI, as we can shorten it in Polish.
It came to the point
that the official American
legal entity issued special
detailed guidelines
describing and prohibiting
the use of artificial intelligence.
And so many of the richest companies,
also computer companies,
prohibit their employees, for example,
from using artificial intelligence
under serious sanctions.
For two reasons.
One, of course, is the security of data,
because AI is just a huge machine
for stealing data.
And the next,
to potentially dangerous errors
that can be caused by using
this artificial intelligence.
Such thoughtless uses.
One of the largest electronic companies in the world,
Samsung Semiconductor,
officially allowed the use of GPT
and here I quote the journalist
of the portal DobreProgramy.pl
""They used the GPT chat,
among other things, to create quick source code corrections,
pasting it into the application,
which meant data leakage outside the company.
The company has reported three cases
of using artificial intelligence in a way
that led to data leakage.
It all happened
in just 20 days.""
End of quote.
For our listeners who visit our blog,
I will put links to interesting
cases, articles,
you will read it in more detail.
Another example from another industry.
Steven Schwartz, a lawyer from the USA,
used the GPT chat during the lawsuit
against Avianca Airlines.
And in court, it turned out that the chat gave him
fictional facts,
and he quote them thoughtlessly in court.
Artificial intelligence does not actually
base its answers
only on facts and data,
but sometimes it invents them itself.
These models work
in a way of statistical
proof of work,
but not based on
some kind of intelligence,
because there is no intelligence there.
Please always remember that.
Mr. Mariusz, coming back to the issue of
intelligence, you said that these systems
can learn, and isn't that
a manifestation of this intelligence,
whatever it is?
And besides, won't it lead to
machines being smarter
than humans in the future?
I will say this, there is no intelligence there,
no wisdom, because is your calculator
smarter? Well, it can count faster
and bigger numbers, but it's
no wisdom, it's just
math. Artificial intelligence,
in my opinion, eliminates the stupidest
from every profession, and that's good,
but at the same time it also creates
new specialties. For example,
the so-called prompter, that is, a person
writing questions to artificial intelligence,
which is not easy at all,
and most people can't do it, and won't
be able to, just like so far most people
can't use computers.
They just can't, ladies and gentlemen.
In my opinion, the same will happen
with these advanced AI systems.
Artificial intelligence tells me
that we should take a break,
I invite you to the topic in a moment.

Hello, Mr. Mariusz, what's going on
with artificial intelligence? Today we are talking
about this with Mariusz Stefaniak,
our expert, financial expert,
economist, a man renowned
in the world of economics. On November 30,
quite recently,
quite quietly, the first anniversary
of the release of artificial intelligence
by the most famous chat of the GTP,
the audience, in fact, everyone.
For the development of new technologies, a year is a lot.
You can already convey some
summaries or observations.
Mr. Mariusz, has the use
of GTP become common?
Yes, and this is already a social problem.
For example, we read in Euronews
that in France, the prestigious
Sciences Po University in Paris
has also announced a strict
ban on the use of AI.
Cecile Keflin, a teacher
in a high school in the French city of Tours,
said in Euronews that 80-90%
of her employees
are against the text generator
in the ESEE, because they perceive it as
a tool for cheating.
You can say with all your might that this is already
a large-scale phenomenon. I assume that
at some point, schools will
have to officially include
AI in the educational aid,
because it cannot be avoided in any way.
In fact, with one click,
any student or child
is able to solve any task,
write any text,
including an advanced
scientific text. I think it's time
for a change. Well, we'll probably
use AI to detect
the actions of AI in the role of a policeman,
in a sense. You predicted it perfectly.
There are already such models.
For example, AI has been
involved in detecting
fake news generated by
AI bots.
I remember a few months ago
we were already discussing this topic and then
we talked about the fears that
people have in relation to the
widespread use of AI
to hand over people
in various jobs. How do you assess
these fears after a year of operation? Have you heard
about someone who lost his job
because AI bit him?
Of course I heard.
In March, Goldman Sachs
predicted that AI
could replace 300
million full-time
jobs in the world and
affect one-fifth of employment,
with a particular focus
on mental jobs.
So far, they have been well defended
by automation and computerization,
for example, all administrative
or legal positions.
It eliminates a lot of
fictional positions where nothing is created,
people do not contribute anything,
but they increase
costs. Someone has to
earn money for these costs.
Such a revolution will be very
beneficial from an economic point of view.
We eliminate people who are
average or even unnecessary
and sit in offices
for years.
They literally live at the expense of others,
such as accounting departments,
administrative departments. We can replace
them with one accounting office
that serves tens or hundreds of companies.
One professional
person with a good
IT background can
do so much analysis
as quickly and as accurately as
tens of people used to do.
The question is whether the labor market will be able
to absorb these people who
are in these positions and find something
else for them. Of course, the fact that
you have 50 new officials
only means that you have to
keep 50 new officials, but if
you walk the streets, it suddenly turns out
that there are no people for many jobs.
For years we have been repeating that
we need millions of migrants
to fill the jobs.
If we suddenly release 100, 200, 300,
500,000 such losers who
only stick stamps there and do nothing,
suddenly these people will be useful.
In Africa, in the fields, in processing,
we need hundreds of thousands of people.
Governments have been telling us
for years how many
millions of migrants we need here.
We need people to work.
And the intelligence sector will release
a lot of average people
or even not very intelligent
and useless people from the country
who sit in offices
and it costs a higher price of real estate,
ladies and gentlemen, for which you all pay.
In fact, releasing them
will only be beneficial.
From an economic point of view, I do not see any
disadvantage in releasing hundreds of thousands
of people from office positions.
I only see the advantages.
Mr. Mariusz, you mentioned students
using artificial intelligence,
lawyers, you mentioned large companies,
but from the point of view of the economy,
most of our national income
is created by small and medium-sized companies.
Do you know any examples from Poland?
Companies that used artificial intelligence
to implement something new, develop
a new solution, gain new markets?
I suspect that there are
such entities in Poland,
but I have not personally
encountered such analyses
as who uses them.
I can give from my knowledge, as I said,
I have some experience here.
In the projects I run myself,
I use such models of artificial intelligence.
We are already testing
dozens of new types.
We are talking about hundreds of different types.
I had direct contact with dozens.
I know that there is still a lot
to be explored.
We put our own artificial intelligence
that will work for us,
use it.
You remember how Samsung or some other examples
that we gave you today tell us
that it is very dangerous.
Someone has access to all your data,
all your questions,
and you can also get a lot out of it,
more than you would like them to know.
If you have your own algorithm,
your own model, your own computer
that is still disconnected from the Internet,
it is a tool that will really work for you.
I am personally a supporter of this approach,
but each of you should choose
how you will approach
this technical, social
and cultural novelty, because at the same time
all aspects of our life will change.
Break number two.
A moment for rest.
We'll be right back to the topic.
[Music]
[Music]
What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
The topic of today's meeting is artificial intelligence
and a summary of the year
of its quite common activity.
Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, our expert.
Mr. Mariusz, you accuse
various state,
political, business organizations
of using artificial intelligence
and using programs
analyzing very large databases
about people, simply speaking,
to manipulate society.
How does it look after a year?
Are there any new examples?
Have we managed to limit this phenomenon?
Is there really anything to be afraid of?
It is definitely a serious danger,
but my personal opinion is that
for most people in the world
nothing changes, because they
did not have any
own possibilities to make decisions.
Before artificial intelligence appeared,
practically the US voters
had no influence on who they were electing,
because there were organizations,
for example secret services,
which in agreement with the largest
media companies,
in the style of Twitter or Facebook,
manipulated public opinion
on a massive scale
with full premeditation,
for example, silencing
all information that did not suit them,
manipulating data.
And we are talking here about an organized,
coordinated by the government
and secret government services
nationwide action
without information.
This process in various
intensification takes thousands of years,
ladies and gentlemen.
It is a great danger that people
do not know what they know,
because most people simply never
verify any information they receive.
Well, for example,
referring to the everyday example
probably of most people's lives
using television platforms.
The rule is that after watching
one movie, the platform prompts us
to watch another movie about a similar topic,
starts to profile us somehow,
looks for our preferences,
our interests.
Similarly, on the Internet,
Google gives us some content, articles.
We are slowly closing in the
bubble of people with similar views,
referring to similar information.
We are also starting to close
on people with different views,
with a different worldview,
with a different range of information.
Isn't it a threat to people,
to intelligence, to development,
to civilization?
I don't see any threat in it.
Everything you have described beautifully
is nothing more than a confirmation bias,
where we are, by nature,
focused on confirming
the things we believe in,
and rejecting those that do not
match our beliefs.
It is not a problem that we are being
prompted to analyze and profile different content.
No. The problem is that you are
notoriously watched every day,
for example, you are eavesdropped.
And based on what you talk about
with your wife at dinner,
devices without your knowledge
eavesdrop on everything,
for example, your phone,
and in a few minutes when you go to the computer
or turn on your phone,
you will have certain claims based on what you are talking about.
And this is dangerous, because it is
a blatant violation of our rights.
Companies do it notoriously,
because who is supposed to stop them?
Politicians, but politicians are funded by these companies.
So why should they stop it?
It is not a problem that
intelligence, profiling, algorithms,
it has nothing to do with it.
It is just the result of
a certain deviation,
a deeper problem,
which is that we agree
that stupid,
dishonest people
rule us.
This is the real problem.
Mr. Mariusz, some people,
probably this is an extreme opinion,
but I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
I am not sure that it is true.
This real world was ugly,
destroyed, poor,
difficult to live in,
and this Matrix was beautiful,
colorful, interesting,
and you had everything to choose from.
You had thousands of dishes,
and in the real world you had only one protein mix,
such a Brea, a poppy.
Choose where you want to live,
where you want to live.
In a boring, dirty,
heavy world,
or in a beautiful, colorful,
and you had thousands of dishes, restaurants,
and so on.
Do you think that this will end with a Matrix,
that we will lie in reality,
or be drowned in some liquid,
subjected to sensory deprivation,
and everything will be controlled by artificial intelligence,
and only some images will be served to our brains,
and some basic nutritional factors
to our bodies?
But nobody even hides it, sir.
They tell us clearly
that it is supposed to be like that.
All this virtual reality,
someone puts a bucket on your head,
you can control it as you like.
Not only that,
recently Elon Musk
officially got a pass
for tests on people, Neuralink.
So they put a cable to your head,
a chip to your head,
and it's already happening, ladies and gentlemen.
We are talking about reality, about realities.
Transhumanism is a completely serious trend,
launched,
and behind it are tens of billions of dollars,
which promote such solutions,
which finance such research.
A person is supposed to be,
according to this ideology of transhumanism,
transformed, where it is half-man, half-machine.
This is reality.
These are normal projects,
which are being carried out,
now there are researches, companies get
new permits for such activities,
and nobody hides that this is supposed to be,
in quotation marks, the future of humanity.
You have outrun my question,
because I wanted to ask when it will happen,
but we already have it.
The next conversation is with Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.
Of course, as always,
we invite you to our website
audycje.krom.pl
and at the end
I want to assure you that the audition
was prepared by three people,
without any participation of artificial intelligence.
See you later.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier,
guest of another radio, guest of our program.
Today we are talking about the assets of politicians
and generally about how to protect the state and society from corruption.
I went to the Business Insider portal
and I saw on the Internet the statement of the wealthy MP Grzegorz Braun.
I don't think I need to introduce this figure to anyone,
he has recently become very loud,
but on the other hand, I immediately reassure the listeners,
we will not analyze the effects of his activities
on the political activity of MP Braun or the usual ones.
I would like to remind you that MP Braun has recently become famous
with the extinguishing of the Hanukkah candles in the Sejm.
On the example of MP Braun, we will talk today about the earnings,
the assets of politicians and how they come to these assets.
Mr. Mariusz, many times on this radio you accused politicians of taking bribes.
As a result of this statement, which is on the Sejm's website,
MP Braun probably did not accept anything,
because according to the statement, he does not even have an apartment.
And his savings are, attention, 785 zlotys in cash and 383 dollars.
Well, it will be difficult to spend the upcoming holidays for such savings.
Let me remind you, MP Braun is 56 years old,
so actually, well, he has a whole life's work behind him
and he has accumulated such a miserable fortune.
Can this be credible, Mr. Mariusz? Let's start with this.
Maybe at first strictly.
I did not accuse anyone of being a thief,
I was just talking about the facts.
When politicians or officials are thieves,
I am referring to the public data on prosecution or prosecution,
where it is obvious the connection of people or positions with criminal enrichment.
Answering your question,
if the data were accurate, as you quoted,
it would be, in my opinion, the most credible politician in Poland.
I will add that, in my opinion, this is how the tax confession should look like
for most politicians, MPs, officials.
Because according to official data,
not much is left to build the right fortune.
The same should be with doctors and a few other professions.
I remember today that a colleague from the Silesian Politechnic
came to them from a team of scientists from the USA.
They were to study the standard of living in Poland,
using the latest computer analytical models they had built.
Unfortunately, the entire research effort turned out to be pointless,
because it turned out that according to their analysis,
the workers spend on average more than they earn.
And it is impossible to analyze this using computers.
Mr. Mariusz, we are returning to this statement by the wealthy Grzegorz Braun.
The latest statement shows that he earned from the Sejm's office,
as an MP, 67 thousand zlotys.
After dividing it into 12 months, this is indeed not an impressive amount.
But the Sejm's president was denied a payment of 270 thousand zlotys
as a punishment for various of his earlier statements, for his behavior.
Additionally, he earned 74 thousand zlotys from copyrights,
he is a director, a creator of culture.
Living in Warsaw is not cheap.
Go to a restaurant, which unfortunately, the MP must do.
It certainly costs a lot more than sitting in a small town.
Maybe Braun really doesn't have any money?
Maybe he doesn't. I don't know.
Putin is also poor, according to tax records.
Maybe he doesn't have a lot of wealth,
an official or politician who acts honestly and has a lot of money,
or a well-known public artist's income or business,
created before he joined politics or took up an important office.
As far as I read and hear about this MP,
his tax statement makes logical sense.
It looks shocking in a list that crushes most of the others.
Let's compare the statement of MP Braun with the statement of another MP,
from the Opole region, an artist, who also earns from copyrights.
It's about Pawel Kukiza.
According to the statement, he has a house worth 1.5 million zł,
a flat worth 350 thousand zł,
savings in cash worth 50 thousand zł,
and he drives an Audi 14-year-old.
For Tantiem from songs, he earned 87 thousand zł last year,
and as a MP - around 200 thousand zł.
Is the wealth he has accumulated adequate for this level of income?
In my opinion, definitely.
Of course, I don't know if it's all his wealth,
or if it's quite poor for such a famous artist.
I can only believe that he has only 100 years left.
So, we believe in MP Kukiza.
But there are also other examples.
Politicians who had to be very economical or very self-sufficient,
because they accumulated a lot of wealth,
and worked their whole lives in the government, for example.
The crazy president of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz,
murdered in 2019.
He was an example of one of the richest self-government officials in Poland.
In 2018, when he won the presidential election again,
the media estimated his wealth to be around 3.5 million zł,
and this is also based on these public wealth statements.
Paweł Adamowicz was the president of Gdańsk for 6 terms.
So, he actually earned only in the government, only from the office.
Could he earn?
Well, maybe he invested, maybe he was lucky enough to get valuation papers.
Is it possible to earn so much?
Everything is possible to earn, but let's add a few facts.
Firstly, there were serious proceedings under the CBA's eyes,
in order to receive huge bribes from him,
and even arrested a few people in this case.
They were supposed to give him money from, for example,
the largest development companies in that area.
And the amounts mentioned at that time were around half a million.
If you are talking about 6 terms,
a lot of money could be accumulated.
You should also remember that the subject of real estate is often mentioned in our auditions.
It is one of the most profitable and still legal businesses in the world.
I said that on this occasion officials from all over the world are being corrupted.
I will give you a well-known example - former US President Donald Trump.
The amount of, to put it mildly, unclearness in this part of his business is impressive.
Because there were even mafia threads, or illegal employees on his buildings.
As you can see, it would be definitely strange
if there were no thieves in this business in Poland.
Which does not mean that I know for sure that Adamowicz was a thief,
because he was never convicted of it.
Nevertheless, I do not want to judge his guilt.
But the facts are that if not for death,
he would be part of a court proceeding.
Another fact is that he never knew how to explain the origin of his property.
He refused to give explanations.
He admitted that he had more money than he showed at that time.
And we are talking about significant amounts.
And we are not talking about some mistake, that he forgot something, missed something.
Because reading the bulletin of public information of Gdańsk city,
in March Paweł Adamowicz gave the Pomeranian voivodeship
five more property corrections.
For completeness of the picture, let's add that his closest co-worker
and then successor on the post, Aleksander Abdulkiewicz,
also has interesting activities in the matter of managing money from the city budget.
As the president of Gdańsk, Aleksandra Abdulkiewicz was in second place
of the so-called list of deposits, according to the ""Fakt"" newspaper.
Because she spent, for the ""Sour Cream"" advisors, as it was called,
PLN 641,000.
The pawn shop's camera was never cleared,
because of Adamowicz's death.
And in total, as far as I know, no official was convicted.
And if the CBA's decisions were reliable,
it could mean that even a whole network of people involved could go there.
Mrs. Mariusz, I invite you to the break.
Music
The end
What's the deal, Mrs. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economic and financial expert,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation,
our weekly guest on the radio ""Innego Radia""
and not only.
I would like to remind you that our programs are available on the website
audycje.com.pl
Mrs. Mariusz, as a state, as a society, we try to protect ourselves
from corruption, which is very dangerous for the state.
For example, years ago, we introduced mandatory property certificates
for politicians, judges, councillors.
Basically, to make it impossible, or at least make it difficult
to take illegal benefits, so that these properties are transparent.
There are also benefits registries that take, for example, gifts.
These certificates, from what I observe,
arouse a lot of emotions when they are shown once a year on the Internet.
It is known that they are also studied by the Treasury,
the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau.
It is known that such income is hidden in certificates.
The former minister Sławomir Nowak lost his job
because he did not enter his watch into such a certificate.
Is such a mechanism effective?
In my opinion, it does not give much or does not give anything at all.
As for Nowak, as far as I remember, he lost his job the second time
when the prosecutor's office issued a charge in the case of this famous
or not famous watch.
It was only about expensive gifts from businessmen
earning on government contracts,
which, in my opinion, completely changes the whole situation.
Let's call it Adamowicz's case.
Ultimately, the court sentenced Nowak to 20,000 zlotys
for making false property certificates.
It is not an effective intimidation.
I personally do not like the whole climate of current politics,
which sees nothing wrong in accepting gifts or even almost public bribes.
The whole environment seems not to condemn this at all.
For example, in that case, Donald Tusk publicly stated after all this,
that he ""highly appraises"" Sławomir Nowak's words and his morals.
It is difficult not to agree that we very often encounter
the attitude of some ridicule towards such accusations.
Once on the Internet, such statements of the property deputies were quite commonly made.
It was even said that someone would be happy to buy the property of the deputy
for the amount that was declared.
Well, quite commonly, the value of houses, apartments was generally lowered
to lower the value of your property in a situation
when the market value was probably many times higher.
Maybe, for example, someone should be ""exploited""
by paying him such an amount that he gave as compensation
and take over his house or other property.
Mr. Przykład probably gives away what we are witnesses to.
The mystery of the Policzynel is that you can avoid a mandate
or get a treatment in a hospital faster,
not necessarily waiting in line or begging nicely.
I'm just starting to be a little afraid of you when I hear such ideas about exploitation.
It will certainly not change anything for the better.
Communist China has the perfect policy you are talking about.
The Chinese government has introduced especially strict regulations
concerning corruption revenues
covering the highest rank of politicians
and all branches of the administration.
Suspected people are being pursued by special organizations.
Second, it is an anti-corruption campaign.
Corruption is being removed at various levels of power.
Suspected officials are being investigated, accused, convicted.
Third, it is a increased supervision and prevention of corruption.
They even have a system of preventing corruption, sir.
And, for example, these are property declarations.
I will surprise you.
Audits, educational activities, promoting ethics and morality.
Next, international cooperation.
International-scale activities, sir.
They are sending information to each other.
Even in the case of suspicion of corruption.
Receiving funds, securing private assets.
So not only will you be able to take over his apartment and so on,
but also in the whole world you will be able to find out where he is hiding his accounts.
It all started in 2012.
In 2018, the constitution was changed, sir.
Strengthening regulations concerning the fight against corruption.
Do you know what the effects are?
After more than 20 years, the great leader Xi Jinping can kill any person
with a slap on the face, because he did it many times.
But mass corruption has never been as terrible as it is now.
It is not the right direction of action,
because it simply gives only media support and new tools of terror,
and in fact deepens corruption.
Because anyone can be destroyed in a matter of seconds
just because he accuses them of corruption.
And it's that simple.
You were talking about President Adamowicz, who corrected the declarations,
and even many times.
In fact, we gave ourselves the opportunity.
The moment some action appears, someone starts to explain something,
it is enough to submit a declaration correcting our previous financial statements,
we will add something, we will explain that it is an ordinary omission.
There are more such mechanisms.
There are people who cannot in the parliament
to calculate the money spent on delegations,
on foreign trips, on maintaining the embassy office.
Can you explain it with a mess?
These are serious money.
Of course you can, and that's exactly what is done.
Well, maybe it changes the question of criminal responsibility for it.
We explain that it is an ordinary mistake.
I know a case of a councillor from a small municipality,
who did not enter into his property certificate the loan he had drawn.
The case ended in court.
The court decided that this is important information,
it should be in the declaration,
and basically deprived him of his councilor's mandate.
Somehow the system worked there.
Should it be so harsh, really?
Sure, and it works perfectly.
But when it comes to small and unimportant.
Here are the mandates.
You will get the highest mandate,
a person will kill someone driving drunk,
in a car without technical tests,
and will be released completely.
But do you know any effective methods
of fighting corruption, of preventing it?
Of course I know.
And there are at least a few.
Well, at least one, absolutely one hundred percent.
That is, liquidating the cast of politicians.
I know that we need officials,
that we need governments,
but I really can't understand why we need politicians.
They create the law in which we operate.
That's what the lawyers are for.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you for the second episode.
I invite you to the break.
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier,
guest of another radio, guest of our program.
Today we are talking about the assets of politicians
and generally about how to protect the state and society against corruption.
We have a special service for this.
It used to be a police job.
Is such a creation of special services
and actually doubling the competence
a good solution?
Do the services take care of each other?
Do they take care of each other?
What causes better effects of their work?
Or is it the other way around?
Of course it makes sense.
That's why we hear about any arrests or scandals at all.
In my opinion.
However, this is far from effective
on the scale of the entire state.
And no police, as far as I know,
has ever changed the level of crime.
Nowhere.
Poles probably know this perfectly well.
From the PBS-DGA poll,
about 80% of Poles believe
that getting rich in Poland
simply means theft and bribery.
And only a fifth believe
that success in the business
is a merit of honesty and hard work.
Of course, as it is, no one knows the truth
and we probably won't know it.
But it's probably hard to pretend
that in Poland you become famous and rich
because of talent, effort and honesty.
On the other hand, let's see.
The equipment of a professional MP,
so one who does not work professionally,
but devotes himself to work in the Sejm,
according to the information of the Sejm's office,
is 9,892 zlotys.
Taxed.
And the diet, at 2,473 zlotys,
is not taxed.
As I counted, it's about 9,500 zlotys per month.
And let's be honest,
these are not coconuts.
I know the communes where the uncle earns more.
Can we expect that MPs will be
really resistant to the proposal
of accepting bribes for such money?
Of course you can and even should, in my opinion.
Do you know what it's called?
Public service.
It's not and can't be business.
It's just an activity for the common good,
in the so-called public interest.
The idea of working in the office or administration
has been distorted.
And this is pure communism,
hidden under the coat of high ideas,
where the ruling, self-proclaimed elite
is stealing citizens.
You know, soldiers in the September campaign
didn't fight in the government's hall.
They were in the government's hall.
Or AK soldiers.
It was pure public service.
It's clear that communism has won
and still rules us today, in my opinion.
That's why our economy is the bottom.
The state structures are in disarray.
That's why there are more scandals.
No matter who is in power.
So, to sum up what we said today,
as long as we have politicians,
we will have corruption and bribery, right?
I think it's related.
The more we have politicians,
so-called lobbyists,
people who don't know what they're doing,
they are intermediaries,
who don't contribute much,
because they don't know anything,
who are intermediaries from the seller to the client.
What can you expect?
Only this.
Increase in prices, increase in difficulties.
Eliminate intermediaries
and then we have everything better.
Better prices, better service,
better quality, better transparency.
The more fire in the chain,
the greater the chance that one of them will be corroded.
There are more and more of these fires.
These politicians who are,
some of them,
even with such pathetic,
even disgusting characters,
where their thieving connections,
criminal activities
are documented.
They are still in this environment.
They still have an impact on our lives.
They still live on our money.
They don't produce anything themselves.
They don't build any wealth,
they don't build any income.
They only use it.
They are this intermediary,
they are a parasite that sucks the blood of the state.
Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
that money is the blood in the circulation of the state.
And suddenly it flows somewhere,
to some Swiss accounts,
to some real estate,
which are actually then rented somewhere,
they leave the normal circulation.
This is what raises prices.
Because suddenly there is a politician
who has to pay several dozen million to be pushed.
Especially if it's not entirely legal,
or even straight from some
catch-up, etc.
So the more they are forced to pay
any price,
because they have to allocate this money somewhere.
And that's really their problem.
So it seems to me that the more we have
these people, the worse it will be.
And I think you can see it.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you very much for today's conversation,
today's meeting.
I hope that our listeners will think,
that they had a topic to talk about
at the festive table, also about something more serious.
By the way, on behalf of our whole team,
I wish you
peaceful, joyful,
merry Christmas.
And I invite you again to listen

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
Mr. Mariusz is Mariusz Stefaniak,
financial and economic expert.
Today we're talking about the forecast for 2024,
which is coming soon.
I heard the new finance minister's speech in the Sejm.
And, to be honest, before New Year's Eve
I was in a champagne mood.
The minister is happy,
because the economy at the end of the year has great indicators.
At least that's what he explained in the Sejm.
Inflation has fallen from almost 20% at the beginning of the year
to 7% at the end.
The zloty is very strong, we were all surprised.
The Warsaw Stock Index has gone up,
which means that investors are buying Polish companies' shares.
And are these reasons for satisfaction
for the statistical Pole at the end of 2023?
Do you think that suddenly, for no reason,
it's great in Poland,
because someone announced that some indicators,
which he usually calculates himself, are better?
The falling inflation indicators
only mean that the level of currency devaluation
is less dynamic.
The so-called strong zloty is often used in the media,
but not necessarily positive.
I will mention a few basic possibilities
that affect the strengthening of a given currency.
One - economic growth.
Let's face it, it's not our business.
The payment dependencies of Polish entrepreneurs
at the end of October reached almost 10 billion zloty.
69% of debtors are single-person economic activities,
i.e. so-called ordinary Poles.
It's just harder for them.
The giants are usually doing quite well,
and it's they who are boosting the statistics positively.
A million poor people have less than one typical rich man.
So the average will be quite good.
The industry is not doing well either.
New orders are falling under the government.
In November - 17.3%,
in October - 12.1%
and all this according to the GUS data.
Prices are rising, Poles are getting poorer,
companies are falling,
we spend billions on Ukraine,
let's add the money we have to borrow,
because we don't have any.
Let's move on to the next reason.
Higher interest rates in Poland can attract investors,
because they are looking for higher rents and investments.
This greater interest can lead to an increase in demand for gold,
such a need,
so it can be used to boost it.
The so-called reference NBP rate
was raised from an absurd level of 0.1% to 6.75%
and it was maintained for the next several months.
If we looked at the chart for the last 20 years,
we would see rapid drops,
as I said, from an absurd level,
which is practically to zero.
Another reason - the trade balance.
Positive, or additional, trade balance,
which means we send more,
we earn more on sales,
than we pay for what affects us,
can also cause such a boost in gold.
Let's recall that in 2021 we had a negative balance,
at the level of 7 billion,
when in 2020 it was additional and it was 47.
Currently, after three quarters of 2023,
Poland has achieved an additional balance,
at the level of 9.5 billion.
This effect can be the result of a drop in import value.
This is what the ZUS data says,
so if we look at it,
I don't see a reason to be delighted or happy.
Another reason - political and economic stability.
Let's face it, we're not the best example here.
The strength of gold also has its evident disadvantages.
Strong currency may be unfavorable for exporters,
because they become less competitive,
they are simply expensive.
Low activity in this field
weakens our economy in the long run.
Maybe it's slowly becoming more normal,
and you always emphasize that the economy needs
normal, stable conditions to develop.
You're right.
The best thing in the economy is normalization, stabilization.
I can't remember for many years
that something like this has happened here.
Look at our auditions.
A threefold jump in fuel prices, coal prices.
This is not a normal economy, sir.
Mr. Mariusz, in our auditions,
we said many bitter words to President Glapiński.
Meanwhile, he predicted a fall in inflation by the end of the year.
And yes, it's happening.
Shouldn't we pay him back the honor
that his predictions were true?
I showed how little they know how to control
inflation, our misfortune.
In the end, inflation could not go on forever,
because, please note,
that it caused quite a lot of dissatisfaction.
Politicians base their decisions on public opinion,
on the satisfaction of their voters.
The last elections were proof of this.
That it is not allowed to piss off voters too much,
because access to power is over.
In addition, they have undertaken a lot of actions
that destabilize in order to
distort these indicators a bit.
And should we be happy about it?
According to the data and analysis of this wonderful Glapiński,
who we are supposed to praise here today,
inflation at the level of 2.5%
is the goal of the Central Bank.
And here we have three times that.
So someone is wrong by 300% and we are glad he is a genius?
Well, because before you were wrong by 700%, right?
Mr. Mariusz, our experts certainly did not predict
such an increase in the value of the zloty.
At least no one talked about it before.
I return to your reflection on what kind of inflation is good,
because it is very interesting.
When it comes to the economy, development,
the economy is motivated, should inflation be close to zero?
Should it be maintained at some level safe?
In my opinion, the optimal thing for the economy is stabilization,
not a leap, as I said.
What is good for the economy?
Price stability.
Entrepreneurs like stable prices.
This enables planning, forecasting costs, setting prices.
High inflation is a big price uncertainty.
Next, financial costs.
Entrepreneurs use loans to better finance their business.
A high inflation level can lead to higher interest rates,
which increases costs, which negatively affects the business.
Next, inflation affects price stability,
because high inflation leads to greater price variability,
more difficult management, greater risk.
But of course it is worth noting that on the other hand
there is a deflation, i.e. the opposite of inflation,
which makes it very difficult to generate profits.
Therefore, when we talk about what the optimal level is,
you see that high inflation generally
in every aspect of business harms entrepreneurs,
but we must not switch sides.
The best, in my opinion, for business and for the hotel
is non-existent, i.e. zero inflation.
I emphasize, without going into deflation.
This is a very important point.
On the other hand, high inflation is extremely beneficial
for politicians, governments, banks and officials.
Let's wish ourselves zero or close to zero inflation in the coming year.
And this is the first conclusion from our hearing.
For the second conclusion, we invite you after the break.
Mr. Mariusz, a moment of break.
The end
The end
What is the game, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier,
president of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"" today.
We are summarizing a bit of the past year
and we are wondering what the next year will be like.
In my opinion, something like social moods
are definitely better than 12 months ago.
Data from the GUS do not show that unemployment is growing in Poland.
So there is work.
Earnings are growing, which is also shown by the GUS data.
Actually, just wait for the wave of Poles to move back
to banks, to take out loans to buy.
I think politicians are waiting for it.
Do we have a chance for such a second ""heating up""
as we saw three years ago?
If you say that there are such positive thoughts among the citizens,
then why did they change the rulers?
Earnings are growing.
These nominal values that people and officials are getting used to
by showing some strange calculations on it,
they have no value, really.
The purchasing power of money is at stake.
Speaking of this ""heating up"",
a bit jokingly, warm socks do not warm up the body at all, sir.
Because the worst thing is when you throw economic slogans
in the media space, and politicians do it most often,
and none of these pages understands what they say.
""Let's give people 500+, 800+, 2000+,
let's give Ukrainians 40 billion,
as we recently spent.""
Do you think that this money will not appear somewhere on the market?
It will!
We can artificially, as you call it, ""heat up"" the body,
but it is not natural, it is not healthy.
It is such a Frankenstein, a revived corpse.
Because look at the next balance sheets,
the next governments, the next years.
There is a so-called deficit everywhere.
In short, we don't have money, we are in debt.
More and more, more and more.
This debt does not decrease at all, sir.
Literally speaking, it is getting worse.
These slogans have no legal power.
Our enterprises are falling.
In a moment, someone will have to pay off this debt.
This is not a good indicator.
Mr. Mariusz, let's change the perspective a bit.
Let's talk about international affairs.
We are part of the global economy, global politics.
I remember our conversation a year ago,
when we were also summarizing the year 2022
and we were making some predictions.
You were talking about the international situation,
about a very tense situation,
a growing conflict between China and the United States,
about the prepared invasion of Taiwan.
Twelve months have passed
and this conflict has been managed to keep under control.
It did not turn into an open war.
Did anyone get scared by the outbreak of war?
What happened and are we still on the brink of war
or has it calmed down globally?
We can talk about the so-called Damocles sword.
It is a misfortune hanging over our heads
that has not yet fallen.
And maybe it will never fall.
All economic indicators, above all,
tell me that China is in a tragic financial situation.
The United States is in a tragic financial situation.
The war theater knows such things best.
The media always talk about one conflict.
They stopped talking about the Ukrainian war
when the rubble appeared in the gas zone.
And suddenly, magically, they stopped dying on the front.
Because the media stopped talking about it.
They don't remember Syria, they don't remember Afghanistan, Iraq.
All those places where it is still very bad,
where people are still dying,
where there is still no normal life.
There are a lot of such examples, sir.
Only when the media stop talking about something,
people's consciousness suddenly ceases to exist.
The war needs three things, as Napoleon said.
Money, of course.
Exactly.
There is an old saying that I would suggest you remember.
If you want to know the truth, follow the trail of money.
Following the trail of money, Mr. Mariusz,
what will happen if Donald Trump wins the elections in the United States,
who has already announced that he will turn Ukraine upside down with money?
And that he will bring it to peace?
Because such announcements are coming from his side.
What does it mean?
It doesn't mean anything and nothing will happen.
Trump, like any politician, says a lot
and somehow he doesn't get out of it.
Every politician, such a significant politician in Russia,
gets millions for his campaign.
It's surprising that it's even legal,
because if you were getting money from someone
to whom you would write or create some auditions or articles,
you would be done.
I would stop being credible.
It should be like that.
Literally.
And in politics, you take it officially.
And we're talking about tens and hundreds of millions.
Why do governments in such a case cause wars,
support them?
Because someone makes money on it.
Gigantic money.
The arms industry is one of the three most profitable
legal businesses in the world.
Politicians want wars,
because someone finances their campaigns,
cares for them,
gives them gold parachutes
so that they can end up in government
or you have a torn opinion.
So we'll give you a position in the so-called supervisory council,
so don't do anything and we'll make you rich.
A classic example is Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.
His son is in some Ukrainian business
and his dad gives billions, hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine.
A complete coincidence, of course, you know.
So if we have it so traced,
why do you think it concerns President USA,
not some other governments?
Really?
These are official, obvious things, no secrets.
Check it out and stop being fooled
that some magical politician will come,
because someone is behind these policies.
If you believe that there is some idealist,
wonderful, nice, noble man
who works at the high level of politics,
think again.
Stop being fooled.
Trump is not a hero in my opinion.
He is a businessman, he is a politician.
He wants to make his interests easier.
Money turns the world and probably not always in the right direction.
Let this be the second conclusion from our hearing.
I invite you for a break.

What is played, Mr. Mariusz?
Mr. Mariusz is Mariusz Stefaniak.
Financial economist.
Today we are talking about forecasts for 2024,
which is coming soon.
I was recently surprised by the information I saw in the media.
In the United States there are currently a record number of 600,000 homeless people.
When I counted in relation to the number of people,
it is twice as many as in Poland.
The US government is dealing with the whole world.
Should it deal with the internal situation to a greater extent?
Should it do something to reduce the number of homeless people?
Every government should deal with it,
because it is its most important duty -
to take care of its own citizens, its own economy.
A father should take care of his children,
not starve his own children to give candy to strangers.
Sometimes governments act like pathological parents.
They take care of other children more than of their own.
It can't end well for this family.
As for the number of homeless people,
there are many more homeless people there than you would even imagine.
Recently, really gigantic waves are coming.
We are talking about gigantic waves, million-waves of illegal immigrants,
who will also somehow increase the number of homeless people.
And let's add that the Americans are less and less fond of it.
The central government is not doing nothing.
It does everything to increase the number of illegal immigrants and homelessness.
It sounds like we are looking at some crazy people,
who are striving for self-destruction.
But of course we will not talk about it now,
we will not explain it, because it is a completely different topic.
Why is the destruction of the American economy profitable?
It is a kind of indicator of the economic situation
and probably the situation on the real estate market,
which we monitor quite regularly.
At the end of the year, quite negative information appeared
from the Polish real estate market,
that the rent prices are falling, that the prices in the construction industry are falling.
How do you predict the situation on this market in 2024?
These are positive indicators.
We said a long time ago,
in an audition about real estate,
that in fact, at that time,
prices should fall to the level, I estimated, 30%.
These bad rent prices,
these bad prices of new and used apartments,
are deadly for us,
are terrible for entrepreneurs,
for foreign potentates, for politicians.
They are great, they are super profitable.
We let over 15 million foreigners into the country.
It is estimated that about 5 million of them stayed here.
And these are all people who need an additional apartment.
Let's add to this that billions of dollars were pumped in,
in various kinds of contributions,
also to apartments and also to these refugees,
which significantly disrupted the demand and supply system
throughout Poland.
It all reflected, for example, on food expenses.
There are more people who spend,
but they don't spend because they earn.
This is the hook that the rulers somehow don't want to show us.
If it were so that Poles earn more,
afford us richer apartments,
this is a good revelation.
You buy, you enrich, you spend very well.
But you know, in Poland it is exactly the opposite.
Suddenly, millions of strangers arrived,
who do not care at all about Poland being better,
because their country is a different country
and they would like it to be better for them.
The neighbors' children do not want you to be better for the children.
They want them to be better, so they can boast.
""Listen, I have a cookie and you don't.""
That's why, in my opinion, the price drop occurred.
Because, for example, a few million of those a dozen entered,
and these are very big waves.
Do you remember when we talked about what is best for the economy,
for entrepreneurs, for Poles?
Stabilization.
Entering and leaving the million-wave.
Is this stabilization?
We have a new political opening.
With the new year, the government in the country is taken over by a completely new coalition,
a new government, which declares very strong support for Polish entrepreneurs.
For now, we have a declaration.
If you were to advise the government
what to do to maintain a good climate for entrepreneurship,
to have an economic growth that everyone can benefit from,
what would you suggest?
I would suggest that they simply withdraw from politics.
Maybe you should start helping at all,
because for now I can only see the waves of difficulties
or even actions that are destroying Polish entrepreneurs.
Where did this debt come from?
These companies are not able to pay their bills.
And we are talking about ordinary people, these small businesses.
It was they who suffered.
Where is this help?
For me, this is anti-help, this is a damage to entrepreneurs.
So my advice is to stop harming Polish entrepreneurs.
It is best to withdraw from speaking and influencing the Polish economy,
because if they stopped regulating it in any way,
then in my humble opinion,
it would be much better than with all their help,
or even more help.
First of all, the drop in exports,
for example to Russia.
Do you remember the years of COVID,
that is, all the lockdowns, the fall of all business sectors?
Did it not affect entrepreneurs?
Let's also remember the topics of our auditions,
that is, the gigantic prices, for example, of fuel,
other energy sources,
which bear all the other costs in our entire country.
What industry has developed in recent years
to compensate for all that I have just mentioned?
If you were to define your scale with optimism,
to apply the measure and say on a scale from 1 to 10
""I am such a big optimist"" or ""I am not at all""
what would be your reading in this year?
One, when it comes to the competence and intentions of politicians.
Ten, when it comes to the strength and entrepreneurship of Poles.
Two, when we talk about their economic awareness
of the important and necessary facts to make decisions.
By the way, of course, I wish them to take care of increasing their knowledge in the new year.
I think that thanks to you and this broadcast,
we help them in a small way.
Let us remind you that we have created an audition.com.pl for them,
a place where they can get the additional knowledge they need,
and in a much larger scale than we can give them during our auditions.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you very much for today's meeting.
Thank you for all the meetings in the past year, 2023.
I hope that someone found it useful and that the amount of knowledge in our heads has increased.
I also wish you and you, Mr. Mariusz, all our listeners,
that we could meet again next year on the radio and the Internet
and sum up the last months.
Thank you, too.
I also wish you and you to increase your knowledge in the scope of funds, money, economy
and make smarter decisions in this area next year.
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial expert, our expert and our guest.
We also have information for you that the full recording of our audition on the subject of 2023
and the forecast for 2024 can be found on our website www.audycje.com.pl.
See you soon. The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.
Inne Radio in Głuchołazy and the area 105.2.

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, our expert, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about the pandemic.
I would like to talk to you, in the context of the summaries of the year ending, about the pandemic.
Do you still remember the pandemic?
I remember.
It's been four years since the virus got to Europe and since we actually heard about COVID-19.
I remember that atmosphere well.
I know it was a topic that the whole world was living on.
Everyone somehow remodeled their lives.
And today it's history.
Nobody cares about it.
Should we forget about the pandemic like about some black snow?
Should we sum it up somehow sensibly?
Make a report on the gains and losses, assess how the procedures for such situations that are required in the country have worked,
how well the people who should make decisions have done,
see how we all have actually behaved,
or maybe there should be some alternative scenario for these events.
Do you see such a need for calculations?
I don't think it's just me.
I notice many judicial and non-judicial proceedings concerning this in several countries.
To put it mildly, unclear actions of the rulers,
giving huge profits to privileged entities,
without any necessary restrictions and almost without any supervision,
caused that these numerous entities received huge amounts of money from taxpayers.
There are serious suspicions that it was then that officials and decision-makers were bought over.
All this with the knowledge that the actions taken not only do not ensure
that they will be effective or useful,
but almost certainly that their consequences will be harmful
with no documented effectiveness.
All this, as usual, came to pay to the citizens.
In the end, they are the payers of all the decisions of politicians and officials.
They fell, they are falling, and businesses that did not have lucrative assets
were the ones that fell.
That is, almost all of them belonging to ordinary hotels,
from which all these actions, all these targets, all these forced purchases,
all these masks, respirators, all these things that took place,
all this has to be paid for.
I quickly threw myself on the goose and he said that companies are expecting
financial situation to worsen and, among other things, it indicates, for example,
that the cost of employment is going to slow down in the next three months.
We can see that the prospects for ordinary entities are weak, to put it mildly.
If a company looks at the new year and sees only the visage of necessary cuts and delays,
it means that the economy is going badly.
In the industry, indicators worsened in December to over -5.
The worsening was in trade.
These are very serious things.
According to the GUS, 29% of employees work in the industry,
excluding micro-companies, of which 11% work.
In trade 14%, including micro-companies 23%.
So, there will be about 43% of employees in Poland,
uncertain about their positions in the coming months.
Half of the people are potentially at risk of being fired.
Mr. Mariusz, we have spent huge billions on saving companies.
The pandemic may cost us even more.
I will remind you of a fairly recent event.
Pfizer, a vaccine manufacturer, is demanding from the Polish government
6 billion zlotys for vaccines that we did not buy, although they were ordered.
And they are quite right in the sense of common sense.
What is your opinion? Should we buy the vaccines that were ordered and pay for them?
Should we behave like the Polish government?
Of course we should.
Let those who ordered them pay the most.
Currently, they cannot even point out on what basis they made such decisions.
Where the income was introduced, it turns out that they knew that they were not giving anything.
The producers showed it in writing and demanded to be released from responsibility for any consequences.
Someone gives you a medical product, theoretically some medicine,
but at the same time he asks you to sign a document that you are deprived of any protection procedure.
If someone dies, gets sick, something bad happens, they will not be held responsible.
And I don't like it in this whole situation.
Mr. Mariusz, let's take a deeper breath, a moment of break before the next series of questions.
PARROT TV
Parrot TV
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financial expert, our expert.
Today we are talking about the pandemic and we are trying to sum up its economic effects.
We were talking about the call of Pfizer.
It is a serious amount of 6 billion zlotys from the state budget,
which is actually from the pocket of all of us.
This is about 1% of the Polish state budget.
Mr. Mariusz, why does this matter not arouse common interest,
but just dazzled by the media?
Because people have no idea about the economy.
Most people have an economic outlook like a worthy mole.
They only see the tip of their own nose,
ignoring the events that shape their entire future,
and even the future of their children.
This is why politicians always manage to avoid the consequences of their actions
and that is why they continue to do so.
Let's go back to the genesis of this call,
that is, to the events of two years ago,
when the Polish government refused to buy another batch of vaccines,
explaining that the money that was allocated for this
is needed for something else,
specifically for the aid to Ukrainian refugees,
because the war in Ukraine has just broken out.
The government called for a higher necessity clause.
And please tell me what it looks like in business.
Can a higher necessity be a circumstance
that exempts one of the parties from the contract that has been included?
Is it just a search for an explanation and a stretch of the legal basis?
Certainly, with a higher necessity,
it is not a situation where we decide ourselves
that we want to help some other country in their military operations.
This is not a higher necessity,
it does not meet any definition of the regulations.
This is an idiotic explanation.
They could refuse to pay only on the basis of the fact
that the producers of the vaccines lied about their properties.
Of course, you don't have to take such a product or pay for it.
Then such a Pfizer would have to prove
that the vaccines had the properties that were assigned to them,
which we already know exactly that they did not.
Of course, in those days, if we had said something like that two years ago,
we would both be banned, expelled, etc.
Now it is common knowledge.
Now everyone is trying to be smart.
Based on the increasingly revealed data,
it turns out that politicians and decision-makers
quite consciously knew that these products did not have the properties
that they were supposed to have.
How they sold it to people, to society,
how they documented the need for purchase.
Well, you know, this is quite shocking information
that someone buys a medicine that saves lives,
but the buyer knows that this medicine
has no documented properties of saving this life.
The producers write that there is no guarantee that this medicine will work.
And not only that, if all these catch-up affairs come out,
which we mentioned,
then this picture looks catastrophic.
And as you said, people are not interested in it at all.
If you have such an approach,
then every ruling team, seeing this, will say
""Listen, if we accept catch-ups from any company
and it will be a harm to society,
then nothing awaits us as a reward for our actions?
Well, what signal do we send to all officials and politicians?
Mr. Mariusz, but on the other hand,
I have not heard of studies showing
that vaccines had no effect.
However, they did have some population effects.
At least that's what epidemiologists claim.
Of course, you are right.
You will not find this data in the media.
If this data were published,
just like these pseudo-wonderful vaccine effects were published,
as it turns out to be a lie,
then now, if politicians gave everyone simple information,
""Listen, it was not supposed to work,
the producer who produced it wrote to us
that he does not give any guarantees that it has any properties
that we tell you they have.""
There were countries that did not want to agree to this clause,
that there is no responsibility if it is harmful.
And they did not sell these vaccines to others.
There are many things that are not publicly revealed,
but they are revealed as such.
So when you press these people,
they start telling the truth.
First of all, you have to make such actions.
Secondly, you have to have a good will
to make these actions show real intentions and facts.
Who cares about that?
Society has it somewhere.
Politicians definitely care about silence.
What are the media?
Media are associated with the richest people,
and the richest people are associated with the most influential politicians.
And this circle of mutual adoration is closing.
Let's go back to the economic aspect of all this.
I found data.
In Poland, the first dose of the vaccine was taken by 23 million people.
The second dose was taken by 3 million less.
In total, we have received 58 million vaccines,
and the second dose was taken by as many or even more.
Who estimated our needs for vaccines,
if we are to pay for them now?
To be honest, is it important at all?
First of all, you have to reach the source of the problem,
and not look for some goat victim,
or some poor office worker, or some doctor,
or any other epidemiologist.
You have to look for the source of the problem.
And what did you do to him?
He based it on the data he received.
If someone is going to look for a victim,
I see that in this case we want to run away from pointing out the real culprits.
These huge losses.
Because we are not only talking about the vaccine.
All the lockdowns, which were of course illegally applied in Poland,
all the companies that were closed, which were illegal,
all the mandates that were illegal,
and all the activities that were illegal, were senseless.
Not only were they senseless,
they were also extremely harmful,
economically destructive,
and for that we will be paying for it for years to come.
It is much easier to deal with a puzzle like that,
with 60 billion and so on,
than the fact that the number of entrepreneurs in the country will fall,
the number of economic departments will fall,
and in this place, you know,
the nature is quite empty.
Do you know who will enter?
Those companies that did not go bankrupt,
that is, foreign ones.
If someone is bleeding you,
money is flowing abroad,
you are slowly killing your own country, your own citizens.
Mr. Mariusz, but the situation was really special.
How did the governments of other countries behave in this situation?
Were we an exception or were we in the mass?
We were definitely in the mass.
For some reason, all countries
suddenly started to listen to the orders of people like Bill Gates,
who has no legitimacy to issue any orders,
in no field, by no government,
certainly not in the field of health.
It turned out that he was the greatest force
behind the ""rescue"" of the world from the pandemic.
Of course, not all countries behaved like that,
and this is also very interesting,
because I know a few cases,
for example, a few African countries,
did not take any vaccines at all,
any lockdowns, any other actions.
Such a famous speech of the president of Tanzania,
who publicly announced in his speech to the nation,
that he sent samples of some goat, papaya,
some engine oil,
some such absurd things,
to the laboratories,
claiming that these are just citizens' samples.
And it turned out that these samples were COVID-19-positive, sir.
He did not announce it, he said it was some nonsense,
that he simply does not agree with it,
and does not introduce any lockdowns, and that's it.
I will surprise you that Tanzania did not die at all.
Mr. Mariusz, I have data here
about deaths in Africa globally.
260,000 people died of COVID-19.
This is 8 times less than in Europe,
which is a half a billion less-numbered continent.
Weird. Weird, but let's continue the topic in the third part.
I invite you to the break.

What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier,
our expert, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Today we are talking about the pandemic.
We are talking calmly.
Two years have passed since the pandemic ended,
so we can summarize it.
During the pandemic, the government has tried several times,
in various laws, to introduce articles
that release officials, people making financial decisions
from responsibility, criminal responsibility,
meaning that they act in the interest of society
and counteract the epidemic.
There are situations, such as the war,
which require special mobilization,
special treatment of the law,
the law is actually suspended.
Was the impunity needed in the pandemic
to recognize that the authorities are acting
in a state of higher necessity,
in a state of threat to the existence of society?
I don't know, I'm not an epidemiologist.
I can only speak, as I said,
about the closure of businesses
and I know it was destructive.
I also know, as an economist,
that at exactly the same time,
the richest people in the world
became as rich as never before.
Some of them almost doubled their entire income
during the pandemic,
like Jeff Bezos from Amazon.
At the same time, most businesses
fell or fell.

[music]
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
Actually, I saw this time.
Actually, we all saw winter outside the window.
When it starts to get cold,
it's like people start
thinking about heating.
They are interested in how much energy
and coal carriers cost, etc.
Exactly a year ago,
we had an audition about the price shock
which started to
spread after Russian
coal and gas supplies
were cut off to Poland.
A year ago, coal prices
exceeded 3000 PLN per ton.
Now, the price of coal has dropped.
The situation has calmed down.
No one is talking about the shock.
Coal can be bought for less than 2000 PLN.
What's the deal? How to explain this drop?
We didn't stop importing from Russia.
Of course not.
We can say that it was a miracle.
Or what we revealed to the viewers
is a real reason.
Let's remind ourselves
that the whole fuel and energy business
is entirely in the hands of the governments
and mega-rich people
from all over the world.
They are the only ones
who have enough money and connections
to influence politicians
and the media.
And they are the ones who create
all the regulations and views
of almost all people.
For example, all the noise
about this one war in the East
is not justified
by anything but the fact
that someone cares
to launch this war.
Many wars are taking place
at the same time in the world.
Newspapers and TV and media
don't talk about it.
Let's add that this war
is quite far away.
Let's add that there is the famous
coal mine in the East
and the huge mining industry.
Let's add that all those areas
were transferred to Ukraine
in 1954.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
suddenly someone explains to us
that the collapse of our economy
justifies some conflict
far from here.
For you to be aware.
Someone motivates you in the media
that the price can jump twice
or fall, as you said now,
and there is no real economic reason
for it.
The amount of coal has increased in the world.
Why are these crazy things happening?
You earn money only
when there are
rapid jumps and falls.
With stable exchange rates
and stable prices
profits are small or none.
Of course, to speculate
about the world prices of energy
or coal, one crazy person
can do it.
Putting everything on one evil
is a typical political trick
you see on a daily basis.
This party is evil, but ours is great.
But no party is great.
Because there are people there.
And people are great by definition.
You can launch someone
in the media.
But it requires a lot of lies.
These lies, of course, appear,
then they come out.
There is a lot of manipulation,
a lot of speculation, a lot of lies.
I have seen the profit of a very
narrow group of people
who control the most
profitable businesses in the world.
You never have access to them.
Because none of you,
even if you have land with coal
or coal, will ever earn money
because you can't.
Mr. Maryszun, but since we are
dealing with speculation, as consumers
in a sense, we participate in this
procedure or in this speculation.
We must admit that we have fallen into panic.
I recently talked to a wholesaler
who deals with coal trade.
He said that he currently
has full coal warehouses.
Because Poles bought
last year for a reserve.
Now they have basements filled with coal
and they don't buy the coal he has ready.
The wholesaler is waiting for the
home stocks to run out, because he hopes
that then the demand will return.
Will he wait for some normalization of the situation?
People behaved like a typical
novice trader.
They bought on the so-called ""upside""
when the price is the highest
and sell when it is at the bottom.
So the price is the lowest.
Someone made money on this difference.
If the price was 3,500-4,000
and now it is 2,000
then someone has 100% profit.
So he had 1 million, he has 2 million.
He had 100 million, he has 200 million.
He has a billion, he has 2 billion.
Do you understand how it is multiplied nicely?
If you have 100 zlotys in your pocket and you earn 100%,
you have 200 zlotys.
He has a billion dollars and during the year
he has 200 billion dollars.
Mr. Marysiu, let's remind
that before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine
a ton of coal could be bought for 400 zlotys.
So basically this jump
in a year or in two years
is multiple.
Do we have a chance that the price will ever return
to this level of 400 zlotys per ton?
100 dollars per ton?
Why should I fall to this level, sir?
It used to be like that.
You know what? Once the fuel
was about 4 zlotys before the COVID-19
in 2018, sir.
I don't think he will find fuel
for 4 zlotys now.
What happened to the world fuel prices
for the last few years?
We also had an audition
when I was explaining
the price of coal in the world.
I explained that there is a group of people,
for example the so-called OPEC countries,
who sit at the table
and decide what the production will be like,
in short, what the price will be.
They can do any production,
10 times that.
It's not a problem for them.
I guarantee you that today's prices
are based only
on the fact that a group of rich guys
agreed that it will be expensive
and that they produce little.
Do you remember, sir,
that you don't remember
that all these prices,
for example, fuel prices,
fuel prices,
fell to zero at some point,
so you could buy
thousands of tons of fuel
literally for 0 zlotys.
I'm just saying,
only the richest could benefit from it,
ladies and gentlemen.
If someone has the opportunity
to make a lot of money,
to make a contact, to get some knowledge,
then on these jumps,
that fuel cost 4 zlotys,
then it cost 12 zlotys,
I remember, at the stations in Poland,
these are the things that really
make a difference.
Three elements must exist at the same time,
ladies and gentlemen, to make it happen.
If there is no one of these elements,
the whole business will not work.
So, always pay attention to all these things,
these conflicts, all these jumps,
these refugees, eco-craziness.
There is always something like this.
There are officials, politicians, the government,
there are media,
and there are super-rich people
who make money on it.
We can always show these three elements
working together for one purpose.
And now, if these billionaires
suddenly get rich with these hundreds of billions of dollars,
then they take your money
and there is no other way.
Because someone needs to take this money.
Just like in the stock exchange.
Someone has to lose, ladies and gentlemen,
the stock market notes, so that someone can get it.
There is no other way to make money in the stock exchange.
If someone is happy, someone has to cry, ladies and gentlemen.
After the break, we will return to the energy market discussion.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I wanted to persuade you today to talk about the situation of farmers,
because I was looking at the latest data of the BUS
and I was surprised, because the price of wheat in Skupie in the last year has fallen
at least in our province, but I suspect that in the whole country, by 40%.
It is cheaper by almost half a year.
The farmer will also earn less than a year ago, selling cattle, slightly, 5%, but less.
The crop fell by 15%.
For the milk of cow farmers, they will get 25% less than a year ago.
Only potatoes and wheat were rising, but it was within the limits of inflation,
so it was not really like that.
How can you function with such a drop in income?
You can function, as you can see, but I think it would be worth pointing out some aspects
that may not come to the listeners right away.
Mariusz Stefaniak, economic and financial economist.
Today we are talking about farmers, about difficult agricultural business.
If you take into account what resulted from our previous auditions,
the inflation rate was up to 20% year on year.
If we summed it up, it would turn out that this inflation is really a lot,
tens of percents.
The second aspect is that all the products you mentioned in the stores
have risen many times higher than the inflation rate even indicated.
This is a demonstration of this state of agriculture.
Food producers, let's face it, are the most important social group in the country.
It seems that no one appreciates it.
Neither the government, nor the customers, nor any voters.
No one actually ever asks about agriculture.
I have not seen any election campaign for the social masses to be interested in what will be the fate of farmers.
What will be the prices of food under the new government?
The question is probably not how farmers can function,
but how we should function in this system.
Well, we managed to invite Mr. Przemysław Wiankowski, a farmer,
who owns 120 hectares, deals with plant and cattle production.
Let's give him a voice, let him tell us what is happening in agriculture now.
We, farmers, add to it.
Prices are obtained, for example, for wheat.
That year, it was even possible to get 1,600-1,700 zlotys for a ton of wheat.
At the moment, it is from 650 to 800 zlotys, depending on what kind of wheat it is.
The production of this wheat has gone up by 300%.
The price of fertilizers has reached and has been maintained at a very high level since that year.
Mr. Mariusz, let's get back to our conversation.
The inhabitants of the city are often associated with wealthy people,
because they see farmers driving modern tractors for probably over a million zlotys,
living in new houses, well-equipped, basically higher standards than in the city.
Does this mean that agriculture should be, or at least was, an income industry?
It is one of the best-earning industries,
apart from the ""golden three"", which dominates the world.
We are talking about the arms industry, the energy industry and the pharmaceutical industry.
You remember that we talked several times about the richest entities in the world.
One of them was BlackRock, which we mentioned several times.
You will be surprised, but BlackRock also has one of its investment activities.
At least 70% of its assets are invested in the food and processing sector.
Undoubtedly, this sector attracts the richest, generates very serious profits,
but in some strange coincidence, these profits go, as usual, to the pockets of the few.
Polish agriculture is based on generations, and we have been proud of this, on family farms.
The average area of ​​a farm in Poland is about 12 hectares.
Such a farmer will probably not earn to buy a new tractor for a million or a combine for 1.5 million.
He will have to pay for hiring such services.
I checked the prices during the harvest last year.
The service of a combine of a hectare of land was to be paid PLN 600.
PLN 250 for pressing straw on a hectare of agricultural land.
If you add the price that farmers received for a ton of wheat,
then about one third of the profits had to be given to the providers, to those who were even hired.
This is basically the exploitation of family farms.
Indeed, if someone is focused on, for example, grain production,
he practically has no chance of generating any significant profits.
Of course, I also know a lot of examples where you can earn a lot of money per hectare,
but here we are talking about completely different things.
For example, we are talking about farmers, we are talking about farmers of soft fruits.
There were years when you could earn a solid fortune if you had a hectare of raspberries, currants.
A farmer is not the one who only eats grain, because in the present times it is rather impossible to get rich.
Let's take into account and analyze the situation of fruit planters, which you mention.
This year, the minimum wage per hour of work will be PLN 28.
If they have to use the work of seasonal hired workers,
then actually at a price of PLN 15 per kilogram of raspberries, strawberries,
such a worker only at the third kilogram begins to bring income to the planter.
I think these golden times you are talking about have already passed.
There is a very large specificity there.
In fact, the purchase prices can vary from year to year by 100%, 200%, 300%.
So this is a very, very risky industry.
So, in fact, if there is a profit, it is a big profit.
If there is no profit, you just put it in your own pocket.
This is how it works. That's why the lack of stability in agriculture is a big threat.
It requires a lot of knowledge, work and financial input from you.
Modern agriculture, modern economy is much more complex.
Now a farmer is practically a businessman.
He has to be an analyst, he has to be an investor, he has to calculate the risk, he has to predict trends.
If he can't do this, he just gets in trouble, goes bankrupt, has to change his business, get rid of the field.
It all carries a lot of risk.
In our conditions, there is no such protection for the farmer.
We will talk about how the European Union helps or makes life difficult for farmers after the break.
PARROT TV
PARROT TV
What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier.
Today we are talking about farmers, about difficult agricultural business.
I have the impression that the European Union does not facilitate and does not stabilize the conditions in which farmers have to work.
For example, farmers often have to build completely new, sluggish farm buildings
in order to meet increasing standards for the so-called animal welfare.
A year ago, the EU ordered farmers to plow 4% of their land, which also reduces income.
By investing, and they have to invest, our farmers are forced to produce more expensively
or at least they are able to get larger amounts on the market than foreign competition.
They are in a much less beneficial situation, to put it mildly,
than many farmers from many countries, about whom I have information, how they work, what their requirements are, what their rates are.
And it's not even about the famous subsidies, which, as you know, always raise my pressure.
Because if you have to pay for something, it means that it is not wise, that it is not financially self-sufficient.
How can food not be financed?
I have no greater absurdity than the statement that food production may not be financed.
All of humanity exists only for one reason.
That we produce the right amount of food, surplus of food.
That's why there is civilization, that's why we have some technological development,
improvement of lifestyle, development of scientists, literati.
I strongly oppose any subsidies to food production,
by definition, that it's just stupid.
I have no other word.
Mr. Mariusz, since neighbors abroad do not have to meet such requirements,
concerning, for example, welfare, they are able to produce cheaper,
leaving us with cheaper production, or we will defend ourselves with a slave,
or we will pay more to farmers, or farmers will fall.
If you want to maintain the organism with such advice,
then this organism will never be healthy.
Because there is no prospect of this agriculture being normal, healthy, profitable in Poland.
If we take away all subsidies and relief to farmers now,
I suspect that most farmers would simply stop producing,
or in the perspective of two or three years, they would fall into ruin.
This means that our whole economy is based on something that does not work, does not function.
We know that agriculture is in a catastrophic state,
that we have to support it by force, and without this support it will die.
This means that it is in a catastrophic situation.
This is the only conclusion that can be drawn from this.
It is also absurdly overregulated.
When we entered the EU, we were introduced to quotas in agriculture,
which, in my opinion, is an absurd manifestation to the maximum.
If someone wants to increase their milk production,
they have to buy a permit.
They can't do it on their own, because they have such possibilities,
but first they have to get a government permit to produce more milk, sugar beets.
How can you function normally in such a situation?
I don't understand that.
What you are describing is a beautiful example of communism.
Everything is centrally controlled, planned, government, state, party knows best what to do,
how much to produce, shoes, bread, etc.
This is an exact contradiction of the whole idea of capitalism, free market economy, personal freedom.
I'm sorry, but we live in such a case in the communist system.
Nothing has changed.
The economy in communism never works.
Not only that, history teaches us that every communist system
ended at some stage with mass genocide.
Very often, with starvation because of communist governments.
I wouldn't like us to be another example in history,
when communist ideals lead to mass starvation and million-year-long starvation deaths.
But it doesn't change the situation, Mr. Mariusz,
that the structure of our agriculture, based on these poor family farms,
can be simply non-competitive, non-lifelike.
Maybe we have to agree that in a few years,
our land will be owned by large farms, not family farms.
Why should we agree with that?
It all goes in this direction.
The laws of the economy tell us that diversity is the best,
not one monarch, a potentate, who rules over everyone.
It's not the best, sir.
People don't want to have the same loaf of bread everywhere and always.
This is what civilisational development is about,
that we can generate diversity.
Instead of having one type of clothing, you can have 10,000 types of clothing.
Thanks to the laws of the economy,
suddenly someone says, ""Wait a minute, I feel a little better,
I'd like to eat better, live better, look better,
I'd like to have a better standard,
I want to have better food than the mass-produced one in the shop.""
From the farmer, it's ecological, natural, fresh milk, good quality meat, etc.
Then we would talk about such market niches,
where farmers would have these small farms,
produce high-quality products,
get good prices, very good prices for their production,
and if someone wants to eat a cheap mass-produced product,
no one will forbid him.
So why is it not so?
Because we are the ones who violate the law of the economy.
Through ideology, through explicit regulations, punishments, sanctions,
we break the law of the economy.
If you went to Latin America,
you would see people on the streets selling food,
some cookies baked somewhere in their home,
without any sanitary norms, without any permissions.
In Poland, it's totally impossible.
A grandmother with a carrot is being chased by the police.
You know about it.
Because it's explained, ""Listen, for our good...""
It's not quite like that.
If there was no sanepid, we would all die.
No, we wouldn't die.
People know where and what product they buy,
whether it's good, whether it's poisoned or not.
But because we have these restrictions,
we have these imposed rules,
we have these limits,
we have these regulations, permissions, etc.
because of that, everything is more expensive.
Because of that, such permissions are given by a gigantic international corporation.
Because you, as a small farmer,
to get such a certificate,
you have to invest so much money,
that you will never pay it back.
Because you are not able to earn money for it.
Neither for those lawyers you had to hire,
nor for those researches, nor for following the regulations.
You don't have time for that.
That's why we don't have good products,
which would be good, cheap, easily available.
After the break I will ask you about what is happening in agriculture
in other countries of the EU.

What is being played, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier
and the problems of modern agriculture.
Are we doomed to fall
of our traditional model of agriculture?
Last year, there was a lot of noise about the protests of Polish farmers,
even on the eastern border.
This year, since the beginning of January,
in Germany, farmers are protesting hard,
because the German government wants to limit the relief
they have when buying diesel oil.
In Poland, farmers also use cheaper fuel.
The state returns them 2 zlotys of the tax.
We return to the basic question.
Is raising, maintaining various subsidies
is just closing the mouths of the protesters?
Can this solve any structural problem?
Polish agriculture is also falling.
Even our neighbors abroad are also striking at this point.
We, Polish farmers, were striking last year.
This situation has been suppressed a bit,
because various subsidies have been created for our production.
As far as I know, these are not subsidies,
these are subsidies paid by our government, corporations.
We, farmers, are just in trouble.
I think that at this point, farmers have already eaten a little of everything.
And even some of them do not have the strength to fight for this economy.
The economy is getting less and less every year.
Some people just pay a lot of money.
Mr. Mariusz!
This is definitely not going to solve anything.
It only deepens what is sick in agriculture.
I'm not talking about Polish agriculture.
You see, France, Holland, Canada - they protest everywhere.
There are riots everywhere, literally fights with the police.
If you look at it so well, you would see two worlds.
One world of these normal farmers,
who are simply overworked,
being beaten with various regulations, limits, prices,
limiting the price of the purchase,
raising costs, imposing, for example,
genetically modified varieties,
which they can only sow once.
Once a farmer could grow his own seed material.
Now he has to buy it.
Not only that, he can't buy it anywhere,
because it is patented.
This is the property of a very small group of subjects,
often people behind it,
who control practically all the seed material in the world.
You can see the systematic destruction of family, natural, healthy products
on behalf of these mega-giga-concerns,
who pay politicians, pay campaigns,
pay so-called lobbyists,
who, in my opinion, should be put in prison like criminals.
It should be completely forbidden.
This is just legalization of catch.
I have no other word for it.
In Poland, there were also farmers who began to pay attention
to the subject of what is not really said.
That is, that the food we have does not meet any standards.
You talk about all these officials and so on.
Yes, these offices are.
But every now and then, literally every few days,
it turns out that one of the products in a large network of stores
is just poisonous.
Well, that's why these big guys have special privileges.
If you, as one farmer, did something like that,
you did not leave prison.
The harmfulness of food is so absurdly high,
that even most people are not able to imagine it.
That it is even possible.
Few of us have access to healthy, fresh, natural food.
Farmers also have to take part in this very dangerous procedure,
because they also want to increase their production.
Where they deliberately, completely, consciously break the rules,
literally poisoning their customers.
Until we start talking about it in detail,
until we start looking at it,
it will probably be as it will be.
The problems of agriculture are not the problems of farmers,
but the problems of us, because we will eat it.
So maybe it's better to take care of the people who produce it.
Maybe we'll take a look at it.
And in the end, those who poison us,
it's our life, our health and our money.
Mrs. Mariusz, the European Union has openly told coal miners
that they have a chance to work until 2049,
because then it will be liquidated.
Coal mining, coal will cease to be used in Europe.
What are your perspectives on agriculture?
Agriculture is destroyed and this can be seen at every stage.
The fact that these farmers are still alive,
vegetating, some of them even earn less or more,
does not mean that they have any perspective.
They have no perspective.
The only perspective is their complete destruction,
complete decline.
People think, ""Well, it's not that bad.""
""Once there will be a price drop,
then maybe some restrictions will be added,
some pecking, some animal passports,
a few farms will be built,
because some pig farming, bird farming, other miracles.""
But no one cares anymore that farms will never be rebuilt.
Because rebuilding such a farm is, ladies and gentlemen, a few years.
But the market will not wait a few years.
Someone will take over his contracts
and he will simply not have anyone to sell to.
How many very large food producers have disappeared in Poland,
very good food,
because there were some events, some regulations,
which led to this.
They are either foreign producers
or international corporations.
You also remember other auditions.
It's the same in the industry - shipyard,
mining, chemical.
I see such a break in the Polish economy,
where we will only be customers
working for foreign corporations.
How much money do you give foreign corporations?
And how much to Polish producers?
You would be shocked.
You give practically nothing to Poland,
to Poles, to Polish businesses.
What are we supposed to be?
Producers?
Work in foreign companies to buy foreign products?
So where is our sovereignty?
Let's start thinking this way.
The patriot is the one who will work for the good of our economy,
for our economy, for our companies,
for the Polish companies.
These things stay.
Waving the flag - nothing is done better in the economy,
your children will not live better,
nor you.
Because the companies that sell you products
are really your enemies.
Because they want to destroy our native economy,
because it is in their interest, let's face it.
It can't be taken otherwise.
These are our enemies.
Once such people fought.
Now we go and bring them money ourselves.
It can't end well.
Mr. Mariusz, at the end, let's give our guest,
today's audience, a farmer, Mr. Przemysław Wiankowski, a voice.
We are trying to hold it now.
We cut costs as much as we can.
Where we lost, for example, 200 kilos of fertilizer per hectare,
at that moment we are losing 100, or even on some fields.
Some have given up fertilization,
just for the root, so-called.
We just hope that it will somehow be mitigated
and these prices of fertilizer will fall.
It is not known how to approach it.
We also look at the situation in Poland,
what is happening with farmers abroad.
At the moment, the Germans are also striking.
Last year, there was also a grain inflow from Ukraine,
where our government did practically nothing with it.
We were flooded with this grain
and this is also a big impact on our market,
on our price.
There were also moments when this grain was not available,
because it could be sold,
but it was sold as a grain from Ukraine,
where there was no control of this grain at all.
I think that we, farmers, also deserve a decent life,
to provide our children, our families,
with a life and this is normal.
It is more common, because the economy is not created
one day, not one year,
but several generations of families have worked
for our economy, all their lives.
It happens sometimes.
Of course, I had to put a lot of my life's sacrifices
aside for another time,
to achieve what I have achieved.
It's a bit sad and I'm disappointed
with this whole situation,
that I have no help from the government.
Thank you very much for today's meeting.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak
and of course we invite you to listen to all our auditions,
to get acquainted with additional materials,
which we post on our website www.audycje.com.pl
See you later.
The program was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

[music]
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
Oh, there was some information about the Polish Post, and to be honest, we have no reason to be satisfied.
For example, in the Republic of Poland, an article called for the appointment of the former President of the Polish Post, Mr. Mariusz Hołodecki,
and his statement shows that the Post will have 700, or even 800 million in debt, losses, and will be in danger of bankruptcy.
Even the Post's associates are warning that it may collapse.
Can something be liquidated, which has probably four or five centuries of tradition and has always been necessary?
Can the Post go bankrupt?
Yes and no. The Post belongs to the state, so the state itself must collapse for the Post to fall.
In addition, the Post has statutory duties and the implementation of this act is the duty of every government.
Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, our expert, our weekly guest, president of the Foundation Więcej Mądrości.
So why can, and even should, the Post be liquidated?
Because any act can be changed, or a subject designated to be fulfilled can be changed.
Moreover, such molochs, communist experiences, have no meaning for the current figure.
The idea of ​​another transformation, carried out by officials under the guise of politicians, has never worked from an economic and logical point of view.
So the very idea that a large giant managed by officials, owned by politicians, can work is comical to me.
Remember that the Post was created in a different economic, political and technological system.
It could then act, sustain itself, and even make profits.
Currently, it is probably impossible.
I remember that during another hearing I said that state entities only make sense when they have total monopoly.
Then they will hold on.
We all know that postal services are no longer like that.
The time of the Post has passed and the sooner we take it, the less we lose.
We are paying for it as citizens. Let's call it the communist ""cancel"" that the Post is currently in.
Mr. Mariusz, but the Post, you said about the influence of officials on the functioning of the Post.
Theoretically, the Post is a company, belonging to the state treasury, but it operates according to the code of trade companies,
has a president, a management, cannot bring losses, etc.
It has a supervisory board that should ensure that everything works well in it.
So how is it? Does it run a commercial business or does it perform any official, state services?
And therefore, it should also be treated differently.
The Post is not like other companies.
Yes, it follows the same regulations as other companies.
And yes, it is and should be perceived differently.
Only the catch is that it is not entirely about that.
How should state companies exist when they are not monopolists?
For me personally, the Post is the quintessence of a bear.
Tell me, what is this bear for?
Exactly, what for?
Well, nobody knows why, so you don't have to worry that someone will ask.
Do you know what this bear does?
It meets the vital needs of the whole society.
It is a bear, on the scale of our possibilities.
Do you know what we do with this bear?
We open our eyes to the unbelievers.
Look, we say it's ours, made by us, and it's not our last word.
And nobody has the right to cling to it, because it is a social bear,
based on the institution, which will rot,
it will fall on the fresh air and what will be done then?
The destruction protocol.
Real money is earned only on expensive, broken investments.
The Post is this bear, and the bigger and more expensive the bear, the better.
Nobody will dare to ask, why do we need such a big bear?
And of course, dishonest officials get rich best in their teens.
An example may be the rent of the famous hall in Grodzisk Mazowiecki for huge money.
The decision was finally withdrawn and another hall was rented for 364 million zlotys.
But the fine for premature settlement of the contract was 364 thousand zlotys,
and the return of the hall to its original state was another 550 thousand zlotys.
The amount was about a million, for something that never came to fruition.
But someone got this money from our pocket, from the pockets of taxpayers.
Of course, I'm not supposed to judge whether there were any crimes,
scandalous and stupid financial decisions, because I'm an economist, not a lawyer.
I'm just a bear.
I paid 10 zlotys for the recommended mail, these are not cheap things, these are not cheap services.
This is not a situation when you used to pay a zloty or two for a letter.
But back to the basics.
It is easiest to carry out the so-called restructuring in the company,
remove some employees, limit activity, choose what is most affordable.
And here, in the mail of 60 thousand people, the unionists cry that they earn the lowest national,
is, for example, reducing employment a solution for the post office?
These are not the best decisions in my opinion.
They quickly show a drop in costs.
It's a fact.
Over time, this is not a good decision.
If a given business requires great delays, it means that it has been badly thought through and managed for years.
It should not be thrown out of people for the fact that the leadership, the authorities, politicians, high-class officials simply run this company badly.
Normal people, normal Poles, these poor employees, will pay as usual.
So what's best to do?
Change the management and force it to effective and effective financial action.
Unfortunately, it is easier to throw out 100,000 or 10,000 people than to disperse ministers, governments or politicians.
For years we have been adding to all these bears, and then we add to their liquidation.
Honestly, when I look at it all, I ask myself the following question.
Why not get rid of hundreds of thousands of millions of immigrants and take their place these 50,000 from the post office or hundreds of thousands of other similar entities?
The profits will be billions and there will be no unemployment in Poland.
Only on this, of course, officials and politicians do not profit, so let's not fool ourselves, we will not see it.
But we will see a massive liberation of Poles.
Millions of immigrants from foreign, sometimes hostile to us, cultures and adding to the next state bears.
This is how communism works.
Well, the bear you're talking about, he's been losing weight over the last few years, and that's quite clear.
In the press, you can now read about how interesting real estate the post office has sold.
I have it in my town, a very nice post office building.
It was sold years ago, now it serves as a residence.
It's good that it didn't go into ruin.
Is this way of losing weight in your opinion, right?
Let's note that what we have seen since the 90s, it was just losing weight, these state, these PGRs and so on.
All these famous Balcerowicz plans totally ruined Poles in my opinion.
I would call them ""thief's"" privatizations.
The company's property was sold for a smaller amount than the company currently had on its bank account.
Not only for free, they were still making money on it physically.
So when you went to the store, you bought a bag for a thousand zlotys, and there is 5000 zlotys in this bag.
Perfect interest.
For some, unfortunately, Poles lose interest in this, they gain various individuals.
All of this was simply, in my opinion, a theft of national property.
Property developed by our ancestors, by previous generations.
It was they who worked on it, and now someone is simply stealing from us.
Why is this happening?
Because there are people in power who can't do anything, they don't know anything.
Sometimes they have even less pure intentions.
Which results in various scandals, scandals, and other such things.
Which, as you can see, society doesn't teach anything.
If these privatizations were carried out in an economic way,
with a good interest of Poles, it would be a good idea.
But we live in Poland, we see the reality of Poland.
The sale of another large company's property will end with this.
As you said, the best real estate will be sold for a penny,
and the worst, where we have to pay for it, will still be on the budget, i.e. ours.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist, our expert, our weekly guest,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
We're going through the first facts of the Polish Post Office
and we're wondering why it's in a crisis.
People see the Post Office from their everyday life.
They go to the post office to do some simple things.
Digitalization, computerization, scanners.
There are still queues at the post office.
On the other hand, it shows that the Post Office needs its clients.
But on the other hand, it's obvious that it's not doing a great job of handling these matters.
Can't we approach it rationally and somehow improve the activities
so that there are at least no queues?
You know, I'm also having fun with it.
How we were forced in the 90s to make computers accelerate everything,
get rid of tons of paper in offices, unnecessary positions.
The answer to the second part of your question is no.
It's not possible to organize it better.
Because we're going back to the starting point.
The Post Office is not managed by managers who are independent
and can think about how to do it the smartest way.
It's only controlled by the political arm.
And by people who come there from various political branches.
They can't be the top class managers.
Because these people just don't get into politics.
If they get in, they get out.
I've heard of some people who are meritorious
and have some principles in politics.
I wouldn't give them a wallet to keep in the store.
How can these people manage their multi-million assets?
Formally, the representative of the owner, i.e. the treasury,
in the Polish Post Office is the Minister of State Assets.
I wonder where such a loss comes from.
Because 700 or 800 million is a lot of money.
I don't think such a loss in activity occurs in one year.
I suspect it must have been going on for some time.
Why didn't the minister notice it earlier and as the owner, he didn't take any steps?
The misfortune is that they took steps.
If the Post Office were not state-owned, it would have huge profits year on year.
When was the last time you read about the self-releases in companies from this industry?
They are developing, they have profits.
Such an Inpost is a great example, where he started in a situation where the Post Office had a complete monopoly on everything
and despite that, he became a very rich company, a leader in this industry.
Only there are no politicians or officials, ladies and gentlemen.
It's a whole mystery.
It's phenomenal, because we all observe the development of these courier companies.
It happens to us.
We see hundreds of buses every day that arrive on time with ships.
We have already got used to the fact that civilization has brought some changes.
E-mails, SMS, communicators appeared.
Today we don't write so many letters, we don't send a greeting card.
For a few years I really thought that the activity of the Post Office may be endangered.
But if such a market has opened for courier shipments, why doesn't the Post Office use it?
After all, it has a ready-made network of employees, a network of facilities.
It would be enough to enter and develop this activity.
I'm not risking it. That's why we pay 700 million, not 7 billion.
Because it has a super genius business.
If the politicians and officials took over the gold mine, it would also stop paying off.
Do you understand?
They will always be at a disadvantage.
Because the bear is to be big and expensive by definition.
The bear is not to have any profits for society.
It's just supposed to be a symbol.
Manager. No one asks him about the budget. Ask him about the profits.
Listen, how much will you bring us?
The official is exactly the opposite.
He wants to have the highest costs, because no one will ever ask him about the profit.
If it's on the minus, we'll just pay him more. And that's all.
That's why the Post Office has a brilliant business, only those wrong people manage it.
We have an example locally, almost in the neighborhood.
A businessman, a very young man who works in Nysa, in the Opole region.
A few years ago, he founded a courier company.
He developed it to the point that recently in various online videos he boasts that he drives a Porsche,
that he flies a private helicopter.
Well, he actually started from scratch.
The pandemic probably opened up enormous opportunities for this shipping industry.
It turns out that new people in this industry can use it.
You can have such profits that it would seem that the Post Office can also pay for these profits,
for the development of the bear and for the good life of various party nominees.
It makes me wonder all the time, how can you bring such losses with such good accounting?
Of course you can.
Porsche drivers and those who are with these bears also fly helicopters.
This money did not evaporate.
Someone got it.
Do you remember the example I gave earlier with this hall?
He really got this million zlotys.
For a million you can buy a Porsche.
And we are talking about one single case.
Let's look for decades.
How many such actions were there, how many such agreements were there.
Oh, damn, many helicopters fly with this money.
So what, Mr. Mariusz, the investigation commission for the Post Office?
Of course not.
The problem is that no investigation commission has ever achieved anything.
Mr. Mariusz, you grilled the opponent, as they say in politics.
Well, but it's again such bears that we keep showing something there.
We blow this bear and that's it.
There is no effect.
These are just such political games that ""Oh, here I will show you my bear,
if you don't vote for us, then I will fly a helicopter, right?""
The people are still the ones who pay for it.
The one who is still fired is this postman or any other institution.
When did you hear about ministers or this type of high-class officials
who suddenly have nothing to live on?
They are millionaires.
Well, they usually have, even when they leave the office.
This is that the guys who turned out to be a total flop, incompetence,
or even some criminal connotations,
it suddenly turns out that they are millionaires?
And those who are robbed are poor?
Well, what's the point? Why do we allow it?
Neither a politician nor an official will help you in your life.
He can't educate your children, ask for their property, for their future.
He will only want something for himself, because he lives off you.
Politicians and officials do not work out anything.
They only suck up this economic value.
To some extent they can be useful,
but not when she has power, when she decides to rent a hall for half a million.
All these things work for your loss.
They rob you, your families, your children and the future of your children.
Mr. Mariusz, the last round of questions after a short break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist.
And our conversation about the Polish Post Office.
A rather sad conversation.
Recently I received a package from the office of my municipality
with a 2 zloty fine for some kind of attachment or something like that.
I'm not lying, as the youth says.
Probably the cost of this package was much higher than what the office will earn on it.
Even the local people are starting to hire their own couriers or hunters
to deliver the packages to the residents,
because they probably think it's cheaper than using the Post Office.
Another lost market.
Yes, because even a local man can add 2 to 2
and see the low quality of Post Office services and a fairly high price.
Because this subject, as I said before,
doesn't make sense at all in terms of the rules and the economic law.
Well, it's a huge thing, for example, for older people who are used to
always going to the Post Office with a certain matter.
Because it's close, because it's in the city center,
because I know how to do it.
Well, it's a huge capital.
Once older people were used to going to church by horse, by cart.
So what?
They don't go anymore, but they go to church.
Exactly. So they can also send, but they can send by other means.
My grandma, who is 103 years old,
uses a cell phone without any problem.
She doesn't have to go to the post office to go from the phone to the post office,
call, as she used to do.
Why should such a grandma go, which is probably not so cool for her either,
stand in line when she could have it with one click?
Why not?
In my opinion, it doesn't make sense for us to stick to things
that are inefficient and more expensive.
The next government will prepare a law on electronic handouts,
official mail to citizens.
Such a project has already appeared in the previous term,
but everything indicates that it will now be finalized
and somehow rewritten by the regulations.
The Post Office, according to the previous government,
was to organize envelope elections in 2020.
Well, these are huge tasks, huge money.
And I have doubts whether the Post Office will be able to handle such tasks,
whether, for example, it can meet the requirements related to security,
mail data, or ensure the discretion of electronic mail,
because according to this concept, someone will print official emails
to deliver them to people who do not have electronic mailboxes.
Can this be done?
I can already see high costs, long time and a negative effect.
In total, everything except the complete and expensive envelope will be a miracle.
I wonder what the new government will do with it.
To sum up our conversation so far,
it would be appropriate to ask what's next.
What's next with the Post Office?
Well, once the Post Office was allocated telecommunications.
I think with success, because telecommunications were privatized,
it developed in an incredible way.
Maybe we still need to allocate something here, share,
maybe privatize some.
Do you have any suggestions on what to do with the Post Office?
The division of such a monopoly into smaller parts
reduces the pathology and scale of possible financial twists.
The place becomes smaller, so it costs us less.
You just have to take care of what I mentioned earlier,
so that the most valuable part of the business does not run out for sale for free,
and leaving what is of no value and is actually only a cost.
The only question is who is supposed to take care of it.
The same officials and politicians who have been making fun of it for the past few years.
Who is supposed to watch out for a thief,
if there is no one but his friends, whose names he steals?
In my opinion, there is no such supervisory body,
which caught these thieves, eliminated the losers.
Rather, the thieves and losers are promoted,
instead of eliminating them.
If you told me in the last 50 years
how many politicians have been imprisoned,
it would probably be a short list.
The sooner we find a longer one,
the more in strange circumstances it has died.
And the number of scandals,
and we are talking about mega scandals,
is incredibly long.
In practically every government,
we can mention a dozen or so such scandals.
And if so far no one has been counted for decades,
it means that we do not have such a control system,
such a supervisory system.
There is no such thing in Poland.
So what right can some education,
some management of national wealth,
end well?
It is such a shadow over Poland.
It covers everything.
It destroys us, it steals from us,
and we can't pretend that it doesn't exist.
It's not bad in Poland,
because I don't know,
bad things are happening in Poland,
because in agriculture and so on.
It's bad in Poland,
because in Poland there are organizations,
gang organizations, criminal organizations,
which operate very often
with the public consent or cooperation
of sometimes the highest people in the country.
I can promise you,
you and our listeners,
that in a year we will return to the subject
and we will see how the fate of the Post has turned
and whether a new affair of the Polish Post
is really emerging.
I hope not.
Thank you very much for the conversation.
Of course, we ask our listeners to visit our website
www.audycje.com.pl
You will find there up-to-date and archival recordings
from our meetings
and a whole lot of other interesting materials.
See you!

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I read that in the United States, writers and screenwriters will be striking in Hollywood.
Interestingly, they demand not only more money,
but also postulates regarding the use of artificial intelligence.
When writing scripts, it's probably about not using it.
The fundamental question is whether a machine or artificial intelligence,
something artificial, can write better scripts than people?
Have you ever watched a movie created by artificial intelligence?
Funny that you mention it,
because a few days ago I had the opportunity to write a mini-screenplay with artificial intelligence.
It was, of course, a test for such a mini-contest,
but the effects were satisfactory.
It shows that even the currently operating AI
creates at the level of average people,
and this is almost in every field of art.
Because we already know about music, we know about painting,
we know about writing, we know about journalism.
According to my knowledge, it is inevitable that AI will become what computers are.
The stupid will not use it, the average will,
but the intelligent can do brilliant things.
Recently, even in Poland, there was a debate about
how students use artificial intelligence and what impact it may have on education.
What is the point of general education
in the era of general use, for example, of this famous GTP chat,
which writes for students, work?
Is there still a point in examining students?
If so, do not give them back their knowledge.
I have officially seen data that in the USA 89% of students
admit to using the GTP chat to do their homework.
I personally believe that it is good if AI will do idiotic and tedious tasks,
saving children time to gain knowledge, not calculations.
How many years do you remember from the several years you probably spent in school?
Well, I don't know. I never counted it.
That's why, please, think about it someday.
Let's take any book from any subject,
opening it and saying ""God, I don't remember anything, I don't know anything,
I've never used it in my life!""
In business, no one will ask you what grades you had in school,
but what you can do and what effects it has.
Encouraging children to study in school is a guarantee of the most average financial status.
Reviewing the richest people's lists will clearly show that this is exactly the case.
You had the motivation to learn,
and I suspect that 99% of students do not have such motivation.
What are they supposed to have, sir?
What do we need 90% of people after graduation who are,
let's face it, as someone said there, ugly, out-of-shape?
Because they really can't do anything.
They really are not experts, because they don't care at all.
Not that they're stupid.
If you have to go to school and learn subjects that you are not interested in at all,
you will be bad at it.
At this point, such AI will crush you,
as if it will eliminate your status to be maintained.
You have no reason to be in the job market, in business.
I was at a market recently, an ordinary market with vegetables.
A guy was selling them.
It turned out that he was an engineer.
When I was surprised, he said, ""Oh, look, there's a lawyer opposite!""
He's selling them at the market, you see?
Because they earn more by trading vegetables at the market.
Because law studies, engineering studies, are good studies, sir.
And the guys prefer to sell at the market.
Why waste a dozen years at school, where you, as we said, 1%, remember?
It's a lot of money spent on the budget.
A lot of the best intellectual and physical years of young people.
A lot of workplaces for teachers, academic lecturers, etc.
It's a huge economic branch.
You're right, it's like a bunch of officials.
People who are unnecessary to us.
Mr. Mariusz, we will soon come to the conclusion that most of the work requiring some intellectual commitment
will be done by artificial intelligence for us,
soon or in a moment.
And for us, some physical positions will be left.
Absolutely, I agree.
In my opinion, based on the history, we had several industrial revolutions,
from steam engines to computerization, to mobile phones, which also changed a lot.
We already know how it works.
There will be a social sprawl, sir.
Bigger.
So those who don't cope well, for example, with computers, with such modern technologies,
will fall out of business or will be marginalized.
Because their products will be weak.
Their service will be poor.
You will call a company that will have an ordinary list of questions and answers,
which is boring and usually does not answer your question in any way.
And you will have a fast chatbot that will explain everything to you, etc.
With a calmness that you can call and it will not do anything to you.
This company will win.
The second one will lose.
There will be a company that will be able to generate 10,000 articles of a fairly decent class daily.
And the second one will have to hire 100 journalists who will produce a thousand articles
and of different quality.
Which one, you think, will exist in 5 years, which will disappear from the market?
This is obvious.
These are such crushing data, sir.
When I look at the stock charts of individual companies, it is totally crushingly unambiguous for me.
I claim that this will not ruin any disaster,
but will simply make a greater social, financial and economic sprawl.
Mr. Mariusz, we will return to this interesting thread after the break.

What's the problem, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there?
I heard that we have to pay the fine.
A lady named Katarzyna P.
Procedural reasons forbid us to use her full name.
She's a co-creator of the financial pyramid Ambergold.
A very famous scandal 10 years ago.
Katarzyna P. is to receive 6,500 euro.
Actually from us, from the state treasury.
For sitting 6,5 years without a court order in this temporary arrest.
The European Court of Justice has decided that this is an extremely long time.
Who did wrong here?
Polish justice system chasing the fraud
or European justice system defending fraud?
You know, it's hard for me to comment on the judiciary,
because it's not my specialization,
but I can refer to the economic aspect.
The very situation that obvious frauds have been working for years
and despite many reports of damage, no one takes action.
This is a signal that the state is doing badly.
And this is at every level.
From social foundations to the highest levels of executive power,
judiciary, judiciary.
Only that people are looking for escape with capital from inflation,
because they don't want to be robbed by inflation.
Or by the government, of course.
But they fall into the hands of even bigger thieves.
It's like hunting a snake.
A frightened animal that runs away from noise
and falls under the guns of hunters.
And I noticed this pattern in the economy of all countries,
where the state does not act in the interest of the citizens,
but the elite of ruling and financing or even buying politicians.
Today's topic will be especially important for the listeners
and will be an opportunity for us to give a few very practical tips
how to protect yourself from scammers, where to look for help.
We'll come back to this at the end of our broadcast.
First, I still have a set of questions for you.
We talked about the compensation for Katarzyna P.,
but it's not the only financial consequences of the state's failure in the Umber Gold case.
Because earlier the court admitted the compensation of 20 million for 200 people
who invested in Umber Gold and lost their money.
The court found that the state bodies were too late to deal with scammers,
too late to take action to determine and punish these scammers.
The basic question that has been asked several times in this broadcast.
Should we be responsible for the consequences of our financial decisions ourselves,
or should we look at some kind of umbrella of state protection?
Do scammers who have been deceived have to lose their money,
or do all the tax authorities answer?
I would answer in two ways.
One is the ancient Roman saying ""buy and you will be saved"".
As you said, our interest is to protect our wealth.
Unfortunately, being an intelligent and experienced man,
working in the media world, you know perfectly well that it's not about
whether we were careless or stupid,
but we are dealing with something much bigger.
Let's be honest, in such situations, in such scams,
no one will be convicted of the guilt, except for the so-called ""pillars"".
These are people who are deliberately put in front of scams in order to be chased.
And the bosses, i.e. the brain of the whole operation,
most often organized groups, the whole mafia,
use only stolen money and do not take any responsibility.
No one ever blames them.
For decades, we have had systematic, gigantic scams in Poland.
The system is such that politicians, consciously or not,
create a friendly place for the thieves.
Who is responsible for the scam?
The police department, which is being detonated in its own office,
a grenade launcher?
It was not even released, of course.
I expect you to have such people to chase,
some organized groups, some mafia, some gigantic, billion-dollar scams?
Recently, I read the information that leaked from the police,
where they themselves admit that they are a complete failure
in getting new staff.
No one respects them and does not want to work there,
and people are ashamed to work in the police.
This is probably a complete failure.
When I visit different countries, and you probably do the same,
we inadvertently notice how the police works there.
And it is either part of the criminal system,
as, for example, in Ukraine, where they always have some money in their pockets
for the policeman's wallet.
This is a system.
Another example may be, for example, Japan.
If you want to ask someone about something,
then ask the police, because it is the safest,
the smartest and most sensible.
And that's it.
Everyone will know if the police is there to give mandates,
to chase ordinary citizens, not criminals,
or maybe just to chase criminals,
and help citizens.
Let yourself remember what a policeman looked like a few dozen years ago.
And where was he?
They just stood at the intersection, directed traffic,
they were on the streets, because where they were needed.
They did not give any mandates.
There was no such concept at all.
He was on the lookout for order.
You will not see a policeman on the street,
you will not see him at the intersection,
unless it is a big parade,
or some really macabre and big accident.
This is how the role of the police has changed.
That's why people are ashamed to be in the police.
Poop, drinking, drunkenness.
In the Amber Gold affair, other state institutions also functioned,
such as the Financial Supervision Commission,
which should prevent such a situation.
Before there is such a scale of fraud,
the Financial Supervision Commission publishes some public warnings,
warns people against suspicious movies.
Why didn't it work then?
Let yourself remember a simple rule.
The fish breaks its head.
In the Amber Gold affair, you probably realize
how well-documented the participation of people
at various levels related to various control services is.
Whether it will be the tax authorities,
whether it will be some special services,
the police, the police.
These people were more or less involved
in the fact that this affair could have worked for so many years
and could have stolen so many tens of millions of people.
Do you remember our hearing about this speculation bubble in the US?
The foundation of this bubble was a special agency
called to rate these obligations.
It was they who actually stood for it.
They gave high ratings,
sometimes at the highest level,
to securities that were just garbage.
Here we have systemic errors
that lead to gigantic twists and turns.
Because it is impossible to steal hundreds of millions of zlotys
from thousands of people
without the support of the appropriate authorities.
It's not that everyone was a criminal there,
but some people turned their heads
when they felt comfortable and profitable.
We will return to the topic of financial pyramids and how they work
after the break, which I invite you to.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I'd like us to talk about beer today,
although, don't worry,
we'll be advertising alcohol on the radio.
It's more about anti-advertising.
American beer called ""Boot Light""
is produced by Budweiser,
which is also well-known in Poland.
Recently, the beer was advertised
by an American influencer,
who is a transvestite,
and someone who changed his sex.
This influencer is now making a career,
and millions of people follow her profile
on various social media.
The effect of this ad was the opposite of what was intended.
The beer was supposed to sell better,
but its sales fell,
the producer himself states that by 25% officially.
What happened, Mr. Mariusz,
that Americans suddenly stopped enjoying the beer ""Boot Light""?
Good question, and maybe to answer it,
let's start with a few facts.
This famous performance took place on April 1st,
Nomen omen, Fool's Day.
Secondly, you used the word ""transvestite""
because it means exactly
diagnosing medical disorders,
including mental health disorders.
And in the international ICD classification,
this disorder is classified as a gender-identifying disorder.
Thirdly, this man
was a clearly homosexual for years.
From what I checked with a licensed artist
of stage and media works,
and when he was an unemployed actor during the pandemic,
he had the idea of ​​being a woman.
What he says,
currently this man makes millions by pretending to be a woman.
Okay, let's move on to our beer.
We are talking about a company here,
which has over 100 countries,
over 400 well-known beer brands,
and controls practically 30%
of the world's beer production.
Another fact, Bud Light is the best selling beer in the USA.
And it's been for years.
It was.
Well, yes, sorry.
My mistake.
It was the best selling beer in the USA for years.
And it was liked by so-called ""rednecks"",
which is translating into our language ""villagers"",
although it does not quite reflect what a ""redneck"" is in the USA.
But generally they are characterized by a simple lifestyle,
traditional views,
and the fact that they do not come from big cities
and are super modern, breakthrough,
typical Americans from outside big cities.
But do these typical Americans have any problem,
any dislike for transgender people?
No, they absolutely have no dislike.
So what upset them in this ad?
Exactly.
Good question.
As I have seen many specialist comments,
practically no one answered wisely.
What is the real answer, in my opinion?
Because these people felt cheated.
For all the years, all the beers were launched
by sexy girls in bikinis with guys
and they will be somewhere at matches, picnics,
with the USA flag somewhere in the air.
And it was like that for all the years.
Suddenly someone throws it in the trash,
suddenly hangs a rainbow flag instead of an American one,
with a guy pretending to be a woman.
Hello!
We did not drink such beer for all these years!
It's worse than if they poured ordinary water into these bottles,
because suddenly extreme politics and extreme leftist ideology were pumped in here,
which is important,
even half of the leftists in the USA do not accept.
So what is introduced here in this ad,
even the left itself rejects it as something absurd,
senseless, harmful.
And that was why there was such a shock
for the entire American population,
for the American majority.
That's what it's about.
Mr. Marysia, but the ads you mentioned,
used earlier by the producer of this beer,
i.e. ads with beautiful and, let's say, sexy women,
are now treated as unwanted, sexist ads,
presenting women in an inappropriate way.
You're right, indeed.
That's what they explain, at least.
Of course, it's a lie,
because the fact that a woman is sexy and attractive
and arouses desire in men
is not bad, or horrible, or degrading.
On the contrary.
It's her greatest strength,
her attractiveness, her advantage.
Presenting it as something bad
is simply a misunderstanding of the nature of people,
the role of women in the world.
Even a misunderstanding is a deliberate degeneration, in my opinion.
Because I don't believe that people don't know it,
because it's too obvious to not know.
I invite you to a short break.
We'll be back to this topic in a moment.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear?
I've heard some information that has been quite popular in the media lately
about new food rations that are being prepared in big cities.
44 grams of meat per day and 190 grams of protein per day.
Quite funny food rations.
Why so many?
Maybe we can cut it even more?
To 10 grams, for example, or 20 grams of cheese and 10 grams of meat
and black bread and black coffee.
What do you think, Mr. Mariusz?
I personally found it funny and it's double.
As a reader of science fiction works, I've known these concepts for decades.
For example, in the story ""Limousine Ferrier"" by a Polish scientist from physics education
and by the way a brilliant writer,
he described it all in a guaranteed income style,
bitcoin hard wallet,
the one we will pay in stores for all those luxury things
that our grandmothers considered elementary.
Limitations in food access for most people
and unlimited access for rich elites.
So it wasn't fiction, but prophecy, actually.
For me it's science fiction and officially, when you go to the reader's room,
you will see it in the science fiction section.
So I'm coming to it like this.
If someone wants to consider science fiction a reality, well...
But we should explain to our listeners who is the author of this idea.
It's a group of the largest metropolises in the world,
the so-called group of C40 cities,
which also includes Warsaw.
If you were a resident of Warsaw and had such limitations in the perspective of a few or a dozen years,
what would you say to President Rafał Czaskowski?
Nothing.
The repetition of the idea from the science fiction books from the anti-utopia of the 80s
doesn't deserve a debate, in my opinion, but a laugh.
I'm happy with these ideas,
because playing chess in a tournament,
when I see that the opponent attacks me in an absurdly impudent way,
it means that he will be very exposed,
and if he keeps a minimum of a cool head, I will easily win.
So I also look at it this way.
The more absurd the ideas will be thrown at us, the better for us.
Because if these ideas were stoned, based on some scientific things...
Okay, fine.
And when Greta Thunberg comes out and says that we will all die and we are to wear linen shirts to the Bosak,
and she herself flies jet fighters to conferences and gigantic yachts,
I can't take it seriously.
Especially since it has already been revealed, it is no secret,
that all her pseudo-rethinking is read by her from a book.
So someone is just physically controlling her.
And there were such incidents where it turned out that she literally reads it all.
This is a media project.
All these things that they say about good people, eco...
This is just a multiplication of fiction from many decades ago.
For me, the classic proof of this is the American sect of Scientology.
It was created by a physicist, a science fiction writer.
A completely average science fiction writer.
And this religion is one of the richest in the world.
There are people like Tom Cruise, Travolta, and hundreds of other well-known and mega-rich people.
And people believe in it and give gigantic amounts of money for it.
They destroy their whole lives and so on.
So if anyone wants to believe it, please.
But please forgive me, I will not be in the cult of science fiction.
I am too educated, I hope, a rational person to be able to catch up with it.
You are sure that laughter is the best method to simply ignore it and then it will not happen?
Well, the example you gave, Kaczu, that such ideas are simply realized.
Yes, what I am talking about may sound like some kind of attention,
but I know Scientology very well, from its literal creation to the present moment,
when people started to leave this cult, they started to expose it.
People who were even in the highest ranks of power,
they are now just starting to show it all, how it was, why, how it works.
And they are just laughing it off.
This is exactly what we are talking about now.
Scientology, to show you the perspective,
is the only organization in the history of the world that has defeated the US Treasury Department.
It has put it on its knees, literally.
Not only that, they also made the biggest penetration of governments,
better than the state's agents and so on, secret police, literally.
This shows that if you treat it seriously and try to approach it seriously, it is dangerous.
But when ordinary people, who had no power, no agency,
started to laugh it off and show absurdities,
so to say, reveal their ""secret"" news,
suddenly all this power of theirs stopped having any meaning.
Now it is just pathetic, funny, stupid.
And no one treats it seriously anymore.
And I assume that soon this whole gigantic mega-sect will simply fall apart,
because no one will be able to treat it seriously enough.
They will believe in this nonsense, science fiction stories.
If we also understand the basic truth, that below a certain level there is no discussion.
At a certain level of the rhetoric, when partners have more or less comparable knowledge and rationality of thinking,
discussion is the most brilliant method.
But if there is already too much difference in knowledge between the discussion,
the discussion stops making sense.
That's why I will not discuss, you know, with someone drunk, drunk, intellectually impaired,
because it will simply lead to nothing.
As they say, ""Don't argue with an idiot, because he will lead you to his level and overcome it with experience.""
We will discuss in a moment.
At this point, we ask for a moment of break, patience.
We'll be back to you in a moment.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I came back to our conversation, published in July last year, on the pages of the New Polish Tribune.
Well, nine months have passed, actually.
Your preface on the situation on the real estate market has been verified.
It's bad. We all know that.
The construction of housing estates, housing loans, is getting less and less,
there will be 30% of what was taken a year ago.
However, there is no panic sale of real estate.
And there is no wave of consumer losses.
The first question, I think, is fundamental.
Do we still have it in front of us?
Everything I said then is fully supported.
Some, as you rightly noticed, have already happened.
The continuation will follow.
Let's add, maybe to clarify, that your interview was completely unique,
because other newspapers were putting in an endless housing boom,
and were foretelling further profits and encouraging speculation.
You were the only journalist who warned that there was a breakdown.
Well, you warned, I just asked.
But it was your interview.
You published it, you raised the topic.
Others preferred to shout how great it would be, what the situation is,
that housing prices would go up, that there is development here, and so on.
You said a very interesting thing in your interview then.
That people, when making financial and economic decisions,
do not direct themselves with reason, but with emotions.
Nine months ago, everyone said it would be perfect,
because there was still euphoria on the market.
How would you define social moods now?
And moods when it comes to the economy and the future.
I would call it a surprise.
It's like your beloved girl suddenly gives you a kiss instead of another.
You are still smiling, but the smile disappears on your lips,
because you feel a burning cheek.
Well, a slight pain, but you know that something has just ended.
What will happen next?
Then there will be a shock when you find out that she was sleeping with your boss all the time.
And all the sweet kisses were a trick to get money from you
and meet a richer man than you.
Then there will be a breakdown,
when you come to the concept of the scale of what happened
and you will learn the word ""food"".
I see such a scenario.
And it's not just that the market itself will break down,
but that we will pay for its breakdown.
And those who caused it will count the next profits,
because they were making profits all the time,
and people were only living in the Uda.
A very interesting comparison.
Who is this girl?
Please tell me to the end.
This is the housing market.
This is all that suddenly...
You know, you buy a house for 2000,
and it will be worth 400.
You buy it for 400, it will probably be worth 800.
So such a romance...
People fell in love with such a romance with an unknown girl,
because how many people who bought a house speculated
really know about it.
They know about real estate, they know about finances,
they know about the economy.
People threw themselves, who had no idea about it at all.
People entered loans at the age of 30,
without any economic basis.
So it was a romance with a randomly met girl,
who everyone said ""Oh, look what a cool, super girl"" and so on.
And people were delighted, in love, literally.
It was a state of emotional euphoria, in love.
""Wow, everything is up, more and more beautiful, more and more fun.
I made money on this apartment.
I'm renting it and look, I'm still making money on it.""
Well, love.
Love at first sight.
But unfortunately, it was fiction, Uda.
Now the stakes are falling, now brutal facts come,
now comes a double rate of credit.
And suddenly, where is that love?
Where is that wonderful, bright future?
Well, I was checking the prices of apartments in Opole.
According to the data of the National Bank of Poland,
the last average price since the end of last year
is less than 7,000 zlotys per square meter of apartment.
In the case of Opole, you can't see a significant drop.
In other cities it is different, there are drops.
But on the other hand, inflation is very high.
Average rents are rising.
Residences have become more accessible
thanks to the fact that prices are standing and we earn more.
""From what I remember, when I was in Opole,
it's not a big city.
And such prices, as you mention, are some sad joke.
To have prices like in much larger cities?
Where's the point? Where's the economy?
It shows that prices are imposed,
not based on demand and supply.
Well, of course, counting zlotys nominally, as you noticed,
is pointless, because the so-called purchasing power of money is counted,
and it officially drops by almost 20% annually.
So how many loaves of bread do you buy?
How much milk? Butter?
It matters, not how much.
The price of an apartment doesn't matter.
If the number of purchases decreased,
let's say by half, although in fact
these numbers are much lower than I estimate,
the official, as you mentioned,
data from the financial sector, the banking sector,
say a 70% drop in the amount of loans given.
So the fewer people will want to buy these apartments,
because people don't have those hundreds of thousands of zlotys for a tiny piece of land,
because where would they get it from?
So those who had it, bought it a long time ago.
We can safely say that at least
by half the number of willing people fell.
And at this point, it's shocking that the prices of apartments have fallen.
This is shocking.
In addition, let's count the decline of many businesses,
the slowdown in successive ones,
and again we return to the brutal awakening
from the beautiful dream that the media has painted for us for years.
Mr. Mariusz, time for a short break,
we'll be back in a moment.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there?
A lot has happened during our holiday break, after which we cordially welcome our listeners, good morning.
Among other things, the decision was made that in mid-September, together with the elections, Poles will participate in the referendum.
And as many as two of the four referendum questions are about emigration.
We have already touched on this topic in our hearing, but it shows that the topic of emigration is also important for the authorities.
In the 19th century, emigrants built America, a country that is a model of development and success for many people.
Mr. Mariusz, maybe there is no reason to be afraid of emigration, since it has such great potential.
I must admit that I missed our meetings, especially seeing how many important things were happening in the world of Poland and the world economy at that time.
Of course, emigrants built all the civilizations of the world, as far as I know.
So it is definitely a positive phenomenon.
However, we live in probably the strangest moment in the history of the world, because the known and used words mean something completely different than they should.
If a foreign, culturally and lower in development nation massively influences the dissent of its inhabitants,
it was called the invasion of barbarians, not emigration, and it was fought against, not financed.
This is what we should be afraid of, and the consequences, to be honest, can already be seen in economic statistics around the world.
But if someone is paid to come here, it means that the agreement you are talking about is there.
If there is no agreement, you do not pay for the arrival.
The fact that someone pays for it does not mean that it is in the interest of a given country or a given inhabitant, sir.
Mr. Mariusz, but you were talking about mass emigration, that it is dangerous.
We have examples of European countries, France, England, Germany, which emigrated in the 1970s and 1960s on a mass scale.
In England and France, they were often residents of former colonies, in Germany, for example, a large Turkish minority.
How did these countries come to such a wide door to their country?
Good question.
The facts are that the economy of all the countries you mentioned has been as low as ever since the end of the war.
It has never been so bad in England, France or Germany.
Why? Mass naturalization of these inhabitants, for example from Africa.
And now even in Paris, you have a district where the police do not know.
What is happening there on the streets also does not associate with France and Paris, but with the streets, some dark, greyish in Morocco.
The Europeans are not able to do business there, because there is no such method to keep them when they are being robbed, attacked every day.
You will not get a pizza there, you will not get a car, because they are afraid.
If they have to go there, they come in police convoys.
These are the effects of the acceptance of a large number of foreign cultures, lower in development, in education, in the nation.
These are the facts.
It is certainly very burdensome for society, but what impact does it have on the economy?
The German economy, for example, in the 70s, 80s, 90s, was a global potentate.
Yes, it was the largest economic locomotive in Europe.
It has been said so so far, of course, it is definitely not true for many, many years.
The nail in the coffin was not the emigration, as you say, in those years, because it did not harm them.
I mean, it did, but very little.
The nail in the coffin was what happened there around 2010 and later.
I do not know if you remember this gigantic wave of media narration about the famous engineers and doctors of Syria, Africa and so on.
How they are blowing up the German economy, that they have valuable hands for work, they are super educated, they are running away from war, so they will work hard here.
And their millions.
Let's take a look at the newspaper from the previous season, where the Germans were begging, because it turned out that there was no one to collect the ashes in Germany.
Where are they? Where are those millions?
The hand of work.
And some even had two hands, those who came.
Only two left, sir.
But let's think logically.
And you have two options.
You will get money every month for free.
And if you will give birth to children, which for some may be even a pleasure,
you will get more money.
Or you have to learn the language, culture, get up every morning and under the supervision of a raw German, it is very difficult and honest to work.
What do you choose?
You know, I belong to a group of people who would try to somehow take up the work of life and existence.
I would not run away from it.
You see? That's why if you go to Germany, to Great Britain, you will find one.
Oh, Poles, great employees, fantastic, let's hire them.
Because that's what we are.
A normal, intelligent person can not not work.
That's why even those super-rich people find some hobby, so that he would not go crazy, sir.
But you have people who came from a completely different mental world, from different values, and the most important thing that the media do not say at all.
Those who come, despise the country in which they live.
They do not respect culture, they do not respect traditions, they do not respect the nation.
That's why they will destroy it.
That's why they will not assimilate.
They teach us their culture, sir.
Raping our women, imposing their habits.
And it's brutal, literally, without exaggeration, like on the streets of big cities, European, American.
That's why we distinguish, sir, two fundamental realities.
When someone goes to culture to assimilate with it, he aspires to this culture.
A classic example, classical times, the Greek-Roman.
They were the leader.
And all the nations that came there assimilated because they wanted to be Roman citizens.
Now, ask if Ukrainians want to cultivate our traditions.
They do not care at all.
They want to speak Ukrainian.
And now the whole of Poland has Ukrainian inscriptions everywhere.
What economic benefits will it bring us?
Did the Polish emigration to Canada, America or Australia have announcements in Polish?
In them, really?
Did the Moroccans come to France and there were inscriptions in Moroccan?
Go to France today, now.
And do you know what you will learn?
You are in my country, speak my language.
And if not, it's your problem.
The French have such an approach.
And they will say it brutally to you.
Let's take a break and we'll be back in a moment.

What's going on Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear?
I was surprised when I read the latest information from China.
I don't understand what's going on in China.
It's about Evergrande, a global giant.
It's huge, but it's in a big mess.
It's in danger of bankruptcy.
It's in debt.
And suddenly, after a long absence,
this company returns to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
And in one day, its shares grow by 20%.
According to logic, if someone is in danger of bankruptcy,
his shares should go up.
I would like to get rid of such shares as soon as possible,
before they fall to zero.
Meanwhile, it was the opposite.
What's going on?
Interesting question and very useful.
As you mentioned, it is the most debt-ridden
developer company in the world.
And one of the 500 largest companies in the world at the same time.
You are right about the logic.
Unfortunately, we have to remember that China is a communist country.
And everything there is only worth with communist economic logic.
Construction in China is responsible for almost one third of the Chinese GDP.
The Chinese government has found a way to level its internal debts
and at the same time withdraw money from the Chinese
in such a geniusly deceptive scheme
of senseless building of unnecessary apartments,
which in most cases will never be used.
And at such absurdly high prices,
the Chinese are in debt for nothing,
because in fact, no one can afford to buy a plot of land.
I would like to remind you that in China,
in order to have any big and profitable business,
you must have knowledge of the authorities.
In China, the land belongs to the state and no one else.
It is actually impossible to buy land for your own.
You can not only rent it for 70 years,
something like in our age-old country,
but much worse.
Then the government will take this land from you
and sell it again to another developer,
and so on.
Of course, let's add that developers know all about it perfectly well
and build as badly and as cheaply as possible.
It comes to the fact that new blocks
literally fall apart when they are given.
All elevations, ceilings, balconies fall off.
You can break the wall with your finger,
not even being a Chinese Kung Fu champion.
Government profits, developers' purchases of offices
are really astronomical.
According to my well-known estimates,
so many unnecessary apartments were built
in this whole scam scheme,
that it would be enough for 3 billion people.
We are talking about additional apartments for 3 billion people.
And the whole of China has 1.4 billion,
now more or less.
2 times that amount would fit in what has already been built.
It sounds as brilliant as selling ice cream with Eskimos
at high prices.
And it is.
And of course, the whole scheme works to a certain extent.
Like any lie.
Who buys apartments that are in poor technical condition
at the beginning,
in 70 years they will have to be demolished,
and there are too many of them,
it should cause, with normal market mechanisms,
that these apartments will be very cheap.
Yes, you are right.
But it is not so,
because these are communist China, I remind you.
Why do people do it?
Because it is the smartest thing they can do.
Because in China you can't save money,
invest money in any other way.
And part of Chinese culture is that
you have to have an apartment,
especially if you want to marry a Chinese woman.
You understand that the whole mentality of Chinese culture
is involved in this.
The Chinese speculated on apartments on a gigantic scale,
buying something they didn't need,
for money they don't have,
in order to sell it with an astronomical profit
and buy more apartments.
It is exactly a financial pyramid.
A developer's financial pyramid.
Why in this case,
all of this didn't fall, didn't collapse?
It wouldn't be avoided in any normal country.
The most important word in China,
I don't know if you remember,
I once explained to you,
what is the most important word in China?
Please forgive my short memory, I forgot.
Face.
Keeping a face.
On a social, economic and political level.
It is such a big part of the economy,
that the Chinese government can't say
""Yes, we are indeed fraudulent idiots,
the whole economy is a joke,
and it all didn't make sense, that's why it fell.""
No.
They have to have a method of getting out with a face,
no matter what the facts are.
That's why you see what's going on,
and that's why the Chinese government
holds everything very tightly
and can manipulate the data as it wants.
To sum up, I will say that
I will buy these shares myself,
if they are still reasonably cheap,
because even though since July 2020
the stock exchange price has fallen by 99%,
in a moment the government can cause
that they will be high again,
if it wants to.
Mr. Maryszu, but in a normal country,
in a normal situation,
the stock exchanges have to publish
information about their situation
very carefully,
so that the investors,
the shareholders can decide
whether to buy or sell.
Does it work like that in China?
It absolutely doesn't.
Evergrande, as I said,
is the most debt-ridden
developer company in the world,
and in the last two years alone
it has lost about 80 billion dollars.
It doesn't matter, really.
The numbers don't matter,
because really, sir,
another thing is important.
This is a company that is
actually a part of the Chinese government.
You have to remember that.
As long as the Chinese government is active,
exists, is under power,
these companies will also work
if the Chinese government decides so.
Exactly.
And no prices have any impact on it.
They can suddenly get any contracts,
any financing,
any things can go wrong,
because the Chinese government controls it,
not any economy, sir.
Mr. Maryszu, please, a moment of break.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear?
I found the data of the main statistical office, which are related to the end of last year.
It turns out that Poles are increasingly suspending their companies and are not in a hurry to open new ones, at least not at the pace as before.
This is how it is with the market economy, that someone will succeed, someone will fall, someone will fail.
Is the current scale of this phenomenon different from what has been happening in Poland so far?
Or can it be a sign of something bad in our economy?
I think so.
Almost every third entrepreneur thinks about closing the company, and every second one would look for work in the stage.
We read in the research ""Essay Business"" from 2002.
Maybe I'll give a few facts.
Poles are leaders in entrepreneurship on a global scale.
For example, 78% of Poles believe that running your own business is a good idea.
This is the second highest result among 21 countries studied in Europe and the tenth among 50 countries in the world.
So we respect businessmen.
We are entrepreneurs.
Amazingly. And on a global scale.
Not only that, we like entrepreneurs.
77% of Poles believe that people who run a business and are successful should be recognized.
This is the sixth best result in Europe.
So there is a will, there is respect, but unfortunately all these positives destroy the media.
You don't mean the Gazeta Telewizja?
I mean all of this.
In 2016, 58% wrote positively, and in 2019, after three years, only 37%.
It's a drop by half.
These are researches from CBOS.
This shows what's going on.
Poles are an incredibly entrepreneurial nation.
We respect entrepreneurs, but the sudden external factors are disturbing us.
But you're not suggesting that the media are running a campaign that is aimed at entrepreneurship.
No, I have no evidence for that.
I'm talking about facts, not speculations, not assumptions.
I'm talking about facts. These are the facts.
But a Polish entrepreneur is strong enough not to care about media reports and just does his own thing.
I'm sure of that.
That's right, but again, more data.
In 2019, only 6% of Poles wanted to start a company in the next three years, so until 2022.
And this is a result half lower than the average European.
So suddenly, we fall from the leader to people who don't want to start a business.
Not that they don't want to, but it's much lower than the average in Europe.
This must show some disturbing trends.
I have some great positive data.
For example, Poles are twice as good as the average European in the number of existing mature businesses.
So about 13% to 8% in Europe.
So almost twice as much.
But again, in all other aspects, i.e. young, new and just established businesses,
we fall again below the average European.
These are really disturbing data.
For the last 9 years, the index of people running young companies has decreased in Poland from 9 to 5.4% of the population.
However, the index of running mature companies has increased from 5 to 12.8%.
I suspect that it is decided by income.
Mature companies have a good situation and earn well, and young ones, unfortunately, are having a hard time,
so no one is trying to make them.
But why in Europe and in other countries it is not so?
Perhaps they use more support from the surrounding state.
I suspect that it is exactly as you said.
Because indeed, as far as I remember, Poland is in second place in Europe and 10th in the world
among the countries with the most complex business rules.
So this is the Global Business Complexity Index 2021 data.
So we are at the top, where it is most difficult to run a business.
And we are talking about 10th place in the world, 2nd in Europe.
So we are at the very bottom when it comes to conditions.
Which, as you rightly noticed, can lead to the fact that we want less and less.
In addition, as we said, the media do not encourage, do not build a positive image of a businessman.
The same is confirmed by the so-called National Indicator of Entrepreneurship Conditions,
where we are at the very bottom, 15th place out of 22.
Well, that's not encouraging.
Funny. Do you know who is in first place?
Romania, Bulgaria?
No, Switzerland. Because it is the best there.
That is why rich countries have much higher indicators,
so it is better to run a business there.
Where it is bad to run a business, unfortunately, the indicators will be low.
I will only add that Poland got the same points as Belarus.
And it's better to leave it without comment.
All this is also due to the current or contemporary two years of difficulties related to energy increases.
But we'll come back to this topic after the break.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
Mr. Mariusz, I didn't hear it, but I saw it.
Actually, I see it every day,
that in my area, every other house
has been installed in the last years, photovoltaic panels.
In sunny days, they produce so much energy,
that they need to be turned off.
Because the network doesn't accept
that much energy.
It happens especially on Sundays,
when most of the production plants,
which usually use a lot of energy,
don't work.
At the same time, in our area,
every now and then, another company
makes a proposal,
and wants to build huge photovoltaic farms.
In a moment, it will turn out,
that we have overproduction of green energy,
or we already have overproduction
of green energy.
Can it all be somehow balanced,
calculated, and built so many installations,
that it would be just right?
Actually, it could be,
but of course, it's impossible.
It's worth to think,
how it's all arranged.
Firstly, people think,
that connecting something to the network,
solves any issue.
No, it doesn't solve anything,
because it's just the beginning
of the whole scheme.
It's an issue, not only concerning Poland.
It concerns all countries,
which have producers
and energy receivers,
more than one source.
Technically, I know,
that it could be calculated perfectly,
but I know,
that in our system,
in our system of managing networks,
it's totally impossible.
There are only two reasons.
One, it's incompetence,
and obvious carelessness of all other governments
about the security of energy of Poland,
combined with the EU's
imposed limits,
which are in no way
consistent with what
currently works in Poland.
But Mr. Mariusz,
it seems, that you can manage this process,
because you're giving out subsidies,
and in the past, it was quite good,
for people, who install
small photovoltaic installations.
Without such subsidies,
would installation and production
of green energy from the sun
be profitable?
The idea of subsidies is
an economic idiotism for me.
Think about it.
If we have to pay more,
it's stupidity of the government
and citizens.
If it's not profitable for citizens,
it's obviously
a harm to citizens,
and therefore to the state,
and it's called treason.
Because the government has the possibility
and even the duty to know
what is profitable and what is not.
So where are the places for subsidies?
The whole mechanism
is that the influential
and greedy mega-rich
have influence on
greedy and influential politicians.
What for?
To sell illogically expensive,
and sometimes unprofitable
technologies
on a mass scale.
You add
some cool ideology,
a few regulations,
and success is ready.
A politician boasts about taking care
of the destroyed land,
of the past generations,
and of the citizens,
so that they live better and more modern.
A businessman, of course,
counts colossal profits,
which he has never achieved,
acting honestly and according to capitalism.
And the citizen will pay for it anyway.
Because all the subsidies
and all the entities and offices
are living comfortably
from the money taken
from his own pocket.
And they will make his children's lives worse,
because most of these actions
will be of the next generation.
Just like these unfortunate
and in all aspects harmful
wind farms,
which you mentioned.
They have literally no advantages
from any point of view,
and the disadvantages themselves.
Well, apart from, of course,
mega-profit for those who sell them.
Let's add that I'm talking about Poland.
Because there are places in the world
where it makes sense,
but the fees are still expensive
and the efficiency is low.
Just like the whole shop
with these electric cars.
The rule of the economy
cannot be cheated.
So instead of being better,
it's worse.
Which you can probably see with the naked eye,
even being a complete financial illiterate.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you for a break.
We will continue the topic in a moment.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
Mr. Mariusz, there are moments in history when even the economy goes down the drain.
And I would like to offer you a conversation about what is happening now in Israel and Palestine, about the drama that is happening there.
For decades, it has been one of the hottest places on earth.
Different interests meet, Jews, Arabs, full of dramas, human fates, even what is happening now.
Our knowledge of the region is often very superficial and refers to what we repeat, to such running slogans, to opinions that are repeated many times.
One of such opinions is quite often repeated the idea that Shin Bet, i.e. the Israeli internal intelligence, and Mossad, i.e. foreign intelligence, are the best intelligence services in the world.
Meanwhile, these services, as we have seen recently, did not prevent the attack of thousands of terrorists, fighters in Israel, massacres of civilian population.
Should the interview know about such an operation? Could it have avoided it?
I admit that I am not a specialist in military affairs, especially in interviews, but I have found that military secrets are often more connected with the economy and finances than someone might think.
Here, I have met analysts who believe that such a big oversight cannot be a coincidence.
This is perhaps an element of internal struggle, for example, for power, because Netanyahu does not enjoy such an esteem as most people think.
There are also concepts that the government, although it knew about the planned attacks, did not take any action on purpose to have a reason to destroy something that has been a big problem for them for years.
Israel has been waging wars with its neighbors, with Arab countries, for almost 70 years.
The Palestinian autonomy, which it finally agreed to, is not even a state. Hamas is not an official army, it is a terrorist organization.
What political goals do they have for Hamas in such a loud and drastic attack, which ended in a massacre with many victims?
On both sides, and probably in the final balance, when this war is over, it will turn out that there will be more victims on the Palestinian side. Why do they need it?
Let's note that Hamas is not just a regular combat unit.
It is part of the larger forces of Islamic fighters called mujahideen, literally fighters.
I am not going to explain to you in a few minutes all the complexity of the ties, competition, conflicts between many Muslim forces.
I will just say that so far Hamas has been receiving money from Israel itself.
And it was probably recognized by Israel as the only Palestinian organization. And by its fellow British, it was considered a collaborator.
With this act, I understand that it is cut off from this, and thus it gets a chance to finance from rich sheikhs.
The Islamic world is also divided into poor and rich. But they have a unique method.
It is called zakat, and it is a principle of practically every Muslim community to give up the surplus of the property of every Muslim.
In this way, the rich sheikhs pay the units of the suicide fighters to secure their luxurious life.
And on the occasion of this, they try to calm the poor, by covering themselves up against the overthrow of their governments.
This is a fairly complex system of economic ties and completely unintuitive for the West.
So what, Hamas was just running for money attacking Israel?
This is obvious. Do you remember our broadcast where we talk about what is needed to wage war?
Money, money and money. Hamas is no exception here. They also need money.
Israel has long since stopped giving them money because they have become radical.
So this is quite obvious.
Mr. Mariusz, but the disproportion of forces is so great. Israel really has a perfect army.
It can summon 300,000 people in a country that has several million citizens.
They have perfect military technology.
In armed conflicts with Arab countries, it has always decided to make sharp moves, to take a decisive stance.
It has always defended its territory and its citizens.
How could it be expected that such an opponent could win with such a country?
They didn't go there to win. They went there to die.
By sending thousands of fighters to conquer the whole country,
which is written in their assumptions that every citizen is a soldier,
they predicted that those who were sent would die.
So they went to die.
Die and kill.
Yes, because this is the biggest possible gain for them.
You are probably aware of the assumptions of Islam,
including the fact that if you die for the good of Islam, you get the famous virginity and so on.
They are promised luxuries that they currently see in those rich sheikhs.
But they don't have the slightest chance of it.
Not only that, but all those fighters are extremely poor
and don't even have a chance for a decent life for themselves or their children.
That's why joining those fighting groups, those suicide attacks,
is the smartest thing they can do in life to improve the fate of their loved ones.
Most often after death.
This is a typical manipulation that we know in the economy,
for example, financial pyramids.
Give me your money today, and one day you will get so much that you will not believe your luck.
Those sheikhs already have a mega profit today,
and the naive ones are waiting for the promised profits, which they never see anyway.
Mrs. Mariusz, I invite you for a break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I'd like us to talk about inflation today.
After all, it's the favorite topic of economic media for over a year.
Recently, the president of the National Bank of Poland announced
that for the first time in many months, the rate of inflation in Poland has dropped a bit.
In March, we had 16% increase in inflation in a year,
while a year ago it was 14%.
Let's remind that in the first year of the pandemic, i.e. in 2020,
inflation was only 3.5%.
Why is inflation so high in general?
First, maybe an important note.
Talking about inflation is always talking about something
that we cannot say anything about exactly.
About something we don't know.
There is no number that shows us exactly what this enigmatic inflation is.
You can manipulate these numbers quite freely.
The only thing we know about inflation is that we certainly don't know what it is.
This is so that it is known what we are talking about.
We compare price indicators, i.e. prices for a set of articles
that were on average a year ago, two years ago.
That's how it counts.
I know how it counts.
If you understood the technique of counting and the method of creating these averaged values,
you would understand what I'm talking about.
There are three levels of lies.
Small lie, big lie and statistics.
If you have to choose between manipulating prices,
you will suddenly say, ""Wait, wait, this is some kind of science fiction.""
Well, literally, it is.
We don't even know if it's 10 or 20.
That's the truth.
We feel that it is growing, because we feel it on our wallets.
Yes, you are right.
It is definitely visible whether inflation is falling or rising.
Absolutely.
Moreover, each country has its own factors.
The European Union has GDP.
We have GDP, most often used.
In addition, inflation is not one word.
We have many types of inflation.
For example, the Central Bank uses base inflation.
There are many types of calculated, analyzed.
Which shows that we really don't know what we are talking about.
But why is it growing, Mr. Mariusz?
Why is it growing like this?
There is only one reason I know.
I'm listening carefully.
Inflation is a result of a bad economic state.
Ladies and gentlemen, read ""Managing"" with a bad name.
I don't know any other reason.
Apparently, inflation gives the government additional income.
I wonder if it always happens like this,
or at some point the situation simply gets out of control.
It's not really about additional income.
Inflation is a phenomenon that brutally punishes
people who are hard-working, honest,
and rewards losers, thieves and manipulators.
The government uses the most inflation.
They are very good at high inflation.
Especially when we talk about poorly managed countries.
This means that they are paying their internal debt.
In fact, the government has no money, to put it shortly.
It doesn't create anything by itself.
It doesn't produce anything.
It can only live from someone.
From work.
Someone.
And now, when you think about it,
someone's work, i.e. people who really introduce some value to the economy,
are the ones who lose the most on inflation.
And the government that owes heavily,
that is, it can't manage the money it takes from you.
Not only does it take, it also lets go of this money.
Not only does it let go of the money it gets from you,
it also destroys those who give it to it.
It steals them in many ways.
For example, through inflation.
Because inflation steals those who have savings, for example.
It punishes them for having money.
Because you have to separate two things.
A fictional currency, banknotes, from the real value in the economy.
The economy works on two levels.
On the fictional level, nominal, and on the real level.
If we talk about some inflation indicators,
we are also talking about some fictional numbers,
that someone can manipulate, calculate as they want,
choose baskets, set averages.
You know, these are very big possibilities of manipulation.
And the real level,
i.e. what is really the level of life of people rising or falling.
And everyone will know it.
You will go to any country,
and within an hour I will tell you what the economic state is like,
without knowing any parameters, nothing.
Completely.
It's that simple.
Mr. Mariusz, but inflation affects not only Poland,
it affects all the countries of the EU, the United States.
So all economies are sick?
Yes, you noticed it nicely.
Good, quite a deep thought.
You know what globalization is.
That's why all economies are sick,
because if you have five tanks of water,
and you poison one with water,
what will happen after some time, in an inevitable way?
The disease will spread.
Exactly, bravo!
Exactly.
This is a real pandemic.
This is something that destroys us, kills us,
literally, literally.
People are dying and will die en masse
because of the destruction of the economy,
i.e. the source of their sustainability.
Because that's what you live from, what you produce.
And if you don't produce anything,
if someone else destroys the money you produce
and destroys the source of the money you produce,
i.e. for example, destroys your business,
well, you will just die.
There is no other option.
There is no such magic.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to take a break for a moment.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
The whole Poland is talking about the Pandora Gate scandal and it's hard not to hear about it.
It sounds pretty serious.
Watergate in the United States once overthrew the presidency of President Nixon.
Our scandal so far has only been reflected by a snitch,
a certain influencer known on the Internet as Stu,
who is suspected of pedophilia, but we will not be here to judge his guilt or his performances.
I wanted to talk about something else.
Personally, I am surprised, because I started watching these films on the Internet,
watching, listening.
I am surprised that people who are known, mainly because they are known,
can make such a lot of money on it and gain such huge popularity.
In my opinion, this is contrary to the principles of common sense, not to mention the use of economics.
You touched on a few issues at the same time, so maybe one by one.
The Pandora Gate itself came from the mythical woman Pandora.
A beautiful, but not very honest, quite deceitful,
who was sent by the gods to punish people.
And they added such a tight, closed box to her.
All misfortunes were closed there.
And after opening, they were released into the world.
Just like in the myth, the same thing happened here.
Beautiful women, these influencers, but not necessarily honest or wise,
living in unmarried and loose relationships with many often handsome,
usually rich and always almost well-known idols of children and youth,
had dark secrets that freed them to the world.
Among other things, that the beautiful girls were in a relationship with much older idols,
with the participation of various forms of sexual intimacy.
As one of the suspects explained in the media,
all the media should be accused, the largest companies,
singers and parents, for what happened to their children.
We are talking about 12-13 year olds.
They watched music, movies, YouTube channels,
where almost naked women are waving and talking about sex in such a way,
that I assure you, the Lord would not be able to speak publicly.
And the largest female idols are really such a modern form of paraprostitution.
Let's look at the world with the eyes of a teenager, at the world of economics.
What are the richest, most famous women in the world?
Are they wise businessmen, inventors, scientists?
No, there is no such thing.
I challenge the listeners.
Find and give us a very famous and rich woman,
who came to all this alone, only with her own work and talent.
Mrs. Mariusz Maria Skłodowska-Kirill 100 years ago.
She was not rich.
But she is famous.
But she has not lived for a long time.
I'm talking about what is currently, what these 12-year-olds will admire.
Well, I can't think of such an example.
I have two models that, in my opinion, explain almost all women's so-called success in the world.
One, I call it sexy lala,
that is, she finds a much older, disgustingly rich, half-bossy guy.
Another is an immoral and usually not very talented artist,
who earns millions because she knows who to give herself to and does it many times over the years.
And she's not even their wife or lover.
She's like a prostitute on the call.
We are talking about the biggest stars of the television, cinema, world of music,
who gave themselves to the disgusting, influential guys, for example in Hollywood,
to get a million dollars.
Thus, throwing out the most capable and honest women from work.
We are talking about the biggest stars in the world,
in the style of Siama Haq, Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie or Lady Gaga.
They got a million dollars for sex.
They did it, although they were famous and rich,
but they wanted to be even more famous and rich.
They do it out of greed.
And it works, sir!
Let's start to break this phenomenon apart a bit from the beginning.
What do influencers actually do, what do they offer their viewers or listeners,
and how do they earn money on it?
And probably the most important question - how much can you earn on it?
You can earn a lot.
We are talking about tens of millions,
I can already think of people who literally earned hundreds of millions of dollars.
On being, as you say, known for being known,
without any specific measurable skill,
that you can do something, I don't know, do.
Do you remember our hearing about Bud Light and this transvestite?
I remember perfectly, but it's probably an example of which the consequences were the opposite of what was intended.
His campaign, Bud Light beer, ended with the sale of the beer starting to drop rapidly.
He didn't hit it somehow.
Well, maybe he did well on it, but his client wasn't the best.
It doesn't concern anyone. It doesn't concern customers.
It doesn't concern influencers.
And it doesn't even concern companies, sir.
They can lose tens of billions of dollars, and it doesn't affect them at all.
Because CEOs don't get money, sir, when the company is doing well,
but when investors are satisfied.
And if the investor pushed the J&J's, as it was then,
then the CEO gets a bonus, even if the company is falling in the ratings like a stone.
Who will lose on it?
Well, ordinary citizens will lose on it, small shareholders and so on.
Because they put a lot of money into it, and that's the truth.
The clients paid for it all.
Who does it concern?
Nobody, exactly.
So what's the difference?
Now, Americans just drink different beers.
That's all.
Nothing happened.
Mr. Mariusz, but let's go back to this mechanism of becoming popular.
Well, in the past, to appear in an ad, you had to be a famous actor,
known from the scene, from the movie, a famous artist.
What now?
An influencer is enough that there are no scruples, no shame,
because he speaks and shows everything and gains popularity?
More or less, you described it correctly.
You know what? I get an example like fishing.
Influencers are the owners of ponds.
They fish their ponds, and companies want to catch as many fish as possible.
Because that's what they live on.
If an influencer shows ""there are a million fish in my pond"",
and the other one says ""I have 5 million fish"".
Companies calculate the indicators in CPT,
which is such an expense for a thousand people who see our ads, for example.
So it's worth it to give it to those who have the largest audience.
How do you get viewers?
Just like for centuries, something that is attractive is shown,
and people go crazy for it, sir.
What is attractive for such little girls, 12-13 years old?
They used to dream about dolls, Mr. Mariusz.
Now they probably think about success, money, attractive partners.
Well, I don't know what the world can offer.
There is such a magical word - hypergamy.
It is the key to most economic phenomena in the world, sir.
Generally, it's about women dreaming about finding an attractive partner.
Once it meant a strong warrior, etc.
Because he could get food in difficult conditions, defend against danger,
so he was a perfect partner.
Now he's just a rich and influential man.
That's why you have a situation that some beautiful models...
In short, now they should be called prostitutes,
because a model is not a model, just like an actress is not an actress.
Her job is not to be an actress, but to look like a sex symbol.
Let's look at the most successful careers in the world.
Melania Trump.
The first lady in the world, sir.
Poor girl, she came from Europe,
and there she just offered various services, 99% of the time, dismissed.
Oh, there is the first lady!
What kind of lady, sir?
You don't become a lady through such a profession.
The most famous women in the world.
How did they get there?
They officially said it.
They pretended to be a sexually seductive guy in Hollywood.
And in various other places where they were just producers,
had influence on some contracts.
They did it for years.
And they are the idols of these girls.
Mr. Mariusz, let's put a dot, but it's just a break in our conversation.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear from the speaker?
I was wandering around the Internet and found a blog of a Pole who lives in Japan
and who talks about the living conditions of a country that is a world economic power.
Most Japanese people don't have their own home.
They rent apartments for the rest of their lives because they simply can't afford to buy one.
For a 20-meter-high tile, you had to go to Tokyo two years ago,
pay a rent of about PLN 2,000.
A two-times-larger apartment, 40 meters is the standard for a family,
is two times or more expensive.
Only people with a stable job and good income can afford such a rent.
Meanwhile, in Poland, two-thirds of the population lives in their own home or apartment.
Does this mean that the Japanese should envy us and build a second Poland?
Of course not.
I'd rather say that most of them wouldn't fit in here.
Because, as far as I remember,
at least 60% of Japanese people have their own apartment.
But I'm right that the number of apartments that Poles have is a huge number.
This is absolutely true.
But economically, let's face it, it's a completely different world.
Japan was and still is one of the most powerful economies in the world.
As for the cost of living in Japan,
it's not as if you could think that apartments are more expensive,
it's not.
There is a huge dichotomy in Japan,
a gap between Tokyo and the dozens of largest cities in Japan.
Indeed, owning your own new apartment in Tokyo is a task for a billionaire.
A billionaire is not able to get such apartments,
it's practically beyond his reach.
This is absurd, indeed.
But in the vast majority of Japan, apartments are very cheap.
Moreover, you can have an apartment for free.
In the province, I understand, you're talking about the province.
Yes, it's like in Sicily and many other places,
for one euro you can have the whole house.
Why is that?
There are a few elements, but I'll show you the main ones.
One is the effect of the gigantic demographic gap
and the gigantic migration.
Young people are fleeing to Tokyo at all costs.
The rest of Japan is totally depopulated.
In such an absurd way,
that you have a whole school agglomerate in large provinces,
where 20 children go to study.
For a gigantic house.
The whole school has that much.
There are only a few older people there.
That's all.
Really, in the Japanese province,
you would be surprised how it works.
In a large part, it is very traditional,
much more than a traditional Polish village.
This is a very interesting topic.
In addition to Tokyo, in addition to a few places,
a few nights at most, it is not like that at all.
It is not expensive, it is not crowded.
In Tokyo, you can rent a flat easier than in Warsaw.
Because the market works very well when it comes to rent.
Buying, as I said, is practically impossible.
But the flat? Yes.
It is quite real.
People rent and manage themselves quite well.
Mr. Marusz, but from the perspective of a simple man,
people, since their country is a economic power,
since they cannot afford an apartment,
or they live in very modest Spartan conditions.
Japanese apartments are like a cage.
You can't even walk on the floor in your shoes.
Compared to this, we live comfortably, modernly.
So maybe, however, a country that is involved in housing policy in Poland,
and has always been involved,
in this case, has some positive effect.
First of all, walking without shoes is part of their heritage and lifestyle,
not a necessity.
Equipment in a Japanese house is much better than in Poland.
More modern.
If you went to a Japanese toilet,
you would not know what to do, first of all.
And even the richest Poles would have a problem
and would be shocked at how high-level
ordinary, average Japanese lives,
who gets a salary from the company and is not important to anyone.
He is just an ordinary office worker.
That's how it looks.
They just have a different culture.
And they spend their money in a different way.
To make it clear, for the sake of balance,
that for Poles, for Europeans,
the quality of Japanese buildings is a joke.
Because the walls are so thin,
that you can hear every neighbor,
not just your neighbor, but the neighbor's neighbor,
with such details that you would not want to hear it.
However, this is the result of the seismological curse of Japan
and many other factors.
That's right, Mr. Mariusz, let's finish with Japan,
let's go to Poland, to our yard,
but I suggest we do it after the break.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I read some terrifying data about the financial loss of the National Bank of Poland for the past year.
In previous years, the NBP had quite a lot of profits, which always go to the state budget.
And last year, our National Central Bank, led by President Adam Glapiński,
brought 17 billion zlotys in losses.
For me, this is a gigantic amount.
Does this mean that the state budget, i.e. all of us, will be adding to the bank to cover these losses?
The answer is obvious and three-part.
No, yes, it doesn't matter.
Then please divide it into parts.
Why not?
Because the Central Bank is not an ordinary business.
It can work with any loss.
It doesn't need money from anyone, because it creates money itself, as much as it wants.
But then why yes?
Yes, because inflation steals Poles.
And, to put it as gently as possible, the incompetent Central Bank is high inflation and economic collapse.
So we will pay for it through other elements, for example, through inflation.
It's like a policeman at a crossroads, who is supposed to drive cars.
But if this policeman causes traffic jams and accidents,
it's probably a bad sign, because he does more harm than good.
In my opinion, this is the bad policeman, our Central Bank.
And of course, the third part.
So it doesn't matter.
Because the Central Bank is to fight inflation, not to bring profits.
That's why the level of profits or losses is completely irrelevant and shouldn't be assessed at all.
During Mr. Adam Glapiński's term, the NBP had a shockingly high income from the state budget.
They showed 35.54 billion in profits.
And even if there is a loss, it will still be an incredible amount.
The Prime Minister probably wasn't happy, because such money, a few billion, could always be spent somehow.
But how did it happen? How could the National Bank of Poland make losses, if it doesn't run an economic activity?
Yes, I fully understand your surprise.
Because it sounds idiotic.
Someone has losses, someone is printing money.
Well, funny.
To understand this, you have to go through a bit of the basic mechanism of macroeconomics.
Debted governments issue bonds.
When, for example, there is a panic, for example a war, panic behavior occurs in the stock exchanges.
For example, prices jump rapidly.
What makes it jump? Inflation.
Then, interest rates are raised to soothe it.
For example, the National Bank of Ukraine Council made a decision to increase the annual interest rate from 10% to 25% on the 100th day of the invasion.
One time, by 15 percentage points.
Indeed, there are shocking movements, but I'm just showing an example, the most well-known example, the biggest one.
Because generally, these jumps are at the percent level, etc.
This type, even 0.25%, let's say this is such a normal regulation.
Well, here I showed the most well-known, shocking example for an economist.
Okay, but what happens next?
After all these movements, interest rates on local loans increase.
Well, because you know, if the interest rates are higher, banks cannot maintain a low interest rate, because they would lose on it.
So they raise.
But all this is only going to the real mechanism.
For governments to continue to borrow, they must increase the attractiveness of their bonds.
Because who buys bonds for 2% when the bank will get a 5% or 20% lockout, as in the case of Ukraine?
It will stop working.
So all financial entities start overpricing earlier bonds, i.e. the low interest rate ones.
And everything is fine until they have to sell these bonds or wait for the term of their so-called volatility.
2, 5, 10, 30 years.
Because such bonds are actually generated.
However, problems arise when the bank has to sell old bonds.
This is how this loud Silicon Valley Bank fell.
And that's where we have the current banking crisis in the USA, right?
Exactly such a mechanism.
And now, central banks and all really large financial entities are locating their currency reserves,
in Poland it is about 150 billion euros, in the bond of other countries.
So they buy these debt papers for each other.
When they have to sell these papers, they reveal losses.
And that's where the losses of NBP and other central banks come from.
But as I said, these losses don't matter, which we have already talked about before.
Mrs. Marysia, let's take a break in the lecture. We'll be back in a moment.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
We'll get to the topic of our today's broadcast in a moment,
but first, a little jubilee, our jubilee.
Behind us are 25 issues of our economic magazine.
For half a year we've been talking on the radio about the economy.
Haven't we already drawn up topics for conversation?
Indeed, it's going fast,
and I have more topics than I think time for their listening.
It's coming, life brings topics.
Mr. Mariusz, our listeners ask us to bring you a little closer.
You speak very categorically about the economy,
you have clear views,
you often criticize so-called ""famed"" media authorities
which are present in the main media.
As far as I know, you don't do any scientific or research work at the university.
Was it your conscious choice to avoid the university?
Indeed, I once made the decision
not to follow the path of a scientific worker,
because I knew the world of schools, universities and lectures quite well.
For many years I taught at universities, I taught at schools,
but never as an editor,
because at the same time I always worked in business,
I took various positions.
At the university I taught as an external expert.
And I was guided by this,
that by giving someone knowledge,
I should do as I would like to be given.
So without nonsense, without rules,
only to pass on something that has practical value,
that can be used.
And I will be honest, I had dozens of cases
when my former students met me after years
and they hooked me up on the street.
""Oh, thank you, how useful it was for me!""
I was really shocked many times.
But this is the reason for me
why I did not enter this environment.
I got to know it too much, I spent too much time in it
and I did not want to be a part of it.
- But if you were happy with the didactic work with young people,
why did you give up?
- I did not give up.
It's just that you can't do everything at once.
I still teach business courses,
not necessarily always with young people.
You know, as usual, I teach either some specialists
or some management staff.
These are not teenagers, you know.
However, it also gives a lot of satisfaction
that you can share knowledge,
which is gained in great effort and effort.
Years spent in books, years of analysis,
years of practical experience stand behind it.
It all comes with pain, suffering, effort.
Others drank beer, I sat in books,
others drank beer, I worked on two or three stages at once.
You know, something for something.
- Many times in our conversations you refer to your life experience,
to practical knowledge, professional experience.
Please tell us what you did professionally.
- I love knowledge and I would like to know and understand
everything that surrounds us and what is in us.
Because in my opinion, this is the key to knowledge.
At the same time, as I mentioned,
I have been doing business training and advice for about 25 years,
lectures, including lectures at universities.
In the meantime, I was walking the professional path as a senior manager,
reaching positions in the company's management.
I went through all the stages, from ordinary specialist
to management and marketing, to being a president.
At the same time, I also had some scientific ambitions.
However, as I went deeper into the academic world,
I saw that there is little knowledge, but a lot of systems and policies.
These were my experiences.
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe somewhere else it is different,
but I'm talking about my experiences.
I will give you an example.
A professor at the University of Wrocław
introduced me to my doctoral theses.
From one of them I heard that it was cool, but too practical.
To be honest, I didn't believe my ears.
The promoter said that I just had to give more quotes
from the books of these professors,
so that they would look at my scientific theses.
So it doesn't matter how useful or meaningful a doctorate is for the world,
but it matters how many quotes I give from the books of those who will assess it.
I also had my time in politics, where I managed to go quite high.
I met people I had only heard about on TV.
I learned a lot of secrets from the authorities,
how to distribute positions.
I got rid of political views,
when I was working in politics.
And I look at people arguing about political views with a little bit of spitting.
For me, they are like children who talk about things
they really have no idea about.
I recommend it to everyone.
Enter politics, reach some level,
then come back to me and we'll talk.
Fortunately, I withdrew from politics on my own terms,
when I was at the top,
and I wasn't forced to sell my principles for positions or bribes.
Another significant path is probably the expert in the European Funds,
where, as a practitioner, I carried out projects
for a sum of over 5 million PLN.
And I even have one of the first books in Poland in this field,
where, together with specialists from the Ministry
and a few of my colleagues, experts,
we wrote such a manual, which became the basis for my studies.
I went through many industries over the years.
Banking, leasing, telecommunications and IT companies.
Along the way, I met a few millionaires.
Fortunately, I came across you.
All in all, my motto in life is a quote I once read,
that a real man is in bad company only in two situations.
When he is very poor or very rich.
So we take care not to be poor,
and I think that, God forbid, not to become rich.
Thank you for your attention.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I read on the portal many.pl
such information,
which was very eagerly picked up by other media,
that our houses will be visited by the controllers.
And these controllers will check
if we provided real data on our apartment
to the building emission database.
The controller will check what we're burning, what is the house meter.
I omit the doubts that have arisen around this matter,
but I've calculated it briefly.
There are 9 million apartments in this building emission database.
If checking one will take a quadranth,
and probably will take much more,
if we assume that an hour of work of such a controller
costs 35 zlotys,
then the whole operation of the control
will cost at least 100 million zlotys.
Why spend such money?
What does it give? To whom? To the authorities, Mr. Mariusz?
So, all these regulations,
checks, voluntary and forced surveys
serve only one purpose.
It's certainly not the good of these poor, controlled citizens.
The point is to look at it all
in a broader perspective, in the long term.
And then the whole riddle is perfectly explained.
It's all preparation for a great action,
which I've been following for many years.
And I'm telling you that it's absolutely 100% inevitable.
And it's called ""Additional sources of taxation"".
And that's all. There is no other purpose here.
We are super-taxed anyway,
but as you can see, politicians never have enough
to impose taxes, because taxes are additional free money.
So why not take it?
Mr. Mariusz, but there are already various types of databases in offices,
evidence of foundations,
there are age-old branches in books,
every building is written in such a book.
Why isn't it enough for the authorities?
Because there is a huge mess there, sir.
And whoever, whatever he did with real estate,
investments,
it inevitably comes to the conclusion
that there is just a gigantic mess there.
The documents are not organized,
they are lost, there are terrible gaps in the documentation,
departments are between each other,
and offices are also completely between each other,
they have no meaningful exchange of information,
one officer does not know what the other one is doing.
I could give you hundreds of examples that I have experienced,
these are funny on the one hand, terrible on the other,
because it shows that hundreds of thousands of officials
do not know what they are doing.
That's why, if you look closely,
you will see that for the last few years, the government has not been doing so much
better governance, as well as better data collection for Poles,
to tax them better.
You can see it in the tax offices, in the municipal offices,
at any level, and it is obvious to me.
It is 100% clear what it is about,
what is happening, and as an economist,
I know what the purpose of this is.
Mr. Mariusz, for years, we have been scared by the controls
in the houses that are supposed to check
if we have a radio, if we have a TV
and if we pay a subscription.
So far, such controls have not been used en masse.
Maybe we have no reason to be afraid of new controllers.
You know what? We have nothing to be afraid of,
no controllers, because in fact
the only healthy reaction, in my opinion,
would be to throw all these controllers
out on the ground,
dig them out, say that it's all illegal,
we are free people,
and no one will come into our property
with shoes,
when we have already paid for it a long time ago
and sometimes several times.
And this is the basic truth for people to understand.
Taxes are not paid by free people.
Taxes, taxes, were paid by people
who were ""paid"", sir.
They were paid ""paid"".
Taxes were not paid by rich people,
they were not paid by free people.
Taxes were always paid by those
who are at the bottom, ""lost"".
There was a saying,
""A nobleman in the garden is equal to a voivode.""
In short, you could be a super poor nobleman,
but no one had the right to enter your property.
It doesn't matter if he was a king,
it didn't matter, because it was your sanctuary.
As if you were the king here.
Now, you can pack as much as you want
and still hang yourself there.
So who are we in such a case?
We are free citizens.
We are free citizens?
After all, we are the owners of this country.
The officials are our employees.
That's a fact.
In the old Poland,
every tax had to be agreed upon
in the parliament.
It's hard to call all Poles
to one big parliament
where everyone agrees to a tax,
or at least most of them agree to a tax,
because they probably won't agree.
And very rightly.
I will tell you this,
because the whole country is well-governed,
rich or poor.
Just look at the tax system.
It's the best indicator of this.
What should the tax system be like?
Taxes must exist.
The tax system should be very simple.
We only tax the things
that come to us from outside,
i.e. we tax others,
not our own citizens.
Thank you. End of the tax system.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to take a break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there?
A few months ago we talked about protests of farmers against cheap agricultural products that came to us from Ukraine.
And the situation is back to the boomerang.
For a month, Polish transport companies have been protesting on the eastern border.
They simply cannot stand the competition with the cheaper services of Ukrainian carriers.
The carriers themselves have prepared a set of rules that say that if you order goods in a Polish company,
you have to pay at least 1 euro and 10 eurocent per kilometer.
And if you order the same service from a Ukrainian carrier, you have to pay only 60 eurocent.
Almost half less.
Mr. Mariusz, where does it come from?
From the fact that Ukraine is better off with two of its own bottles.
Twice as much, more precisely, than Poland.
And as you can see, the war serves Ukrainians.
Obviously, in every field.
Not only do they get hundreds of billions of dollars in aid,
the Union also maintains several million of their citizens.
I remind you that they were leaving during the biggest pandemic,
when Poles could not visit cemeteries on Zaduszki.
And at that moment, millions of Ukrainians arrived and a miracle happened.
The restrictions were lifted and people stopped dying in a wonderful way.
Ukraine is a wonderful country, sir.
And maybe we should move all our businesses there.
Let's start with the first factors, Mr. Mariusz.
What does it mean that Ukraine cares better about its company?
Do they pay less taxes there?
Do they have less problems with the office management of their business?
Definitely.
Practically, running a Ukrainian company, you have to deal with almost one single thing.
This one thing is the syringes.
If you only manage this, you run a company in Ukraine without any problems,
without any controls, without any penalties, without any state intervention.
It's just a fairy tale.
But the syringes are an additional cost that the entrepreneur has to pay, right?
And it's a mandatory one.
Instead of having 15 types of taxes,
well, one,
the syringe is the foundation of operating in Ukraine, in the Ukrainian business.
It's hard to explain to someone who doesn't have an interest there,
or doesn't know well someone who has an interest in Ukraine,
to understand how different it is.
It's exactly, totally different from what you would have on the other side of the border, for example in Poland.
Running a transport company in Ukraine is just as perfect.
It's infinitely easier in Ukraine.
And up to now, the Ukrainians haven't destroyed our transport company for very specific reasons.
Because they couldn't.
But not because everything was magically more expensive then.
No. It was even cheaper than it is now.
There were transport limits.
When entering the territory of Poland, the EU, Ukrainian companies had to obtain a permit.
And the number of these permits was strictly limited.
Now it's not mandatory.
So they can enter as many as they want, as many as they can.
And this decision was made by the European Commission, not by the Polish government.
So it's actually where the postulates of Polish transport companies are directed.
For me, you know, the whole narrative on two levels I don't like.
First, the limits.
You know what I think about such communist inventions.
How do the limits work?
They only create a grey zone of crime and so on.
How did the mafia in the United States come into being, which they still can't shake off?
By introducing prohibitions.
You introduce limits to anything and you have organized crime.
Greatly financed, because that's what big money is made of, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Marysiu, but it's precisely the people who protest on the border who demand the limits.
Those Polish entrepreneurs.
Because these people, sir, are drivers.
What can they understand from the economy, macroeconomics, economic and entrepreneurship?
Well, each of them runs a small business, so they should basically learn.
For over 20 years I have been advising companies.
I do this professionally.
I also advised transport companies for many years, sir.
And I've been through a bit of these companies in my life.
So I had the opportunity to get into their specifics.
Their profits, losses, how this business is run.
That's why, you know, these people are simply not economists.
They are not analysts.
They are not strategists in terms of sales or marketing activities.
Because they are supposed to know what they are doing.
On transport.
They don't know what economists know, sir.
That's why they don't understand what they demand.
Exactly, Mr. Marysiu, what can you advise them in a situation when they basically have no chance in competition with a cheaper opponent?
Well, just one thing.
Start thinking where the problem is.
Do you know where the problem is?
That they don't know where the problem is.
What is the real problem?
I suspect it concerns most Poles.
Now they complain about the European Union or something.
What a complete nonsense.
The Polish government decides and approves everything.
The Polish government is not subject to the European Union.
It is a sovereign country that can make sovereign decisions.
We don't need to beg anyone here.
And you can't consult with anyone, really.
Just look at Hungary, for example.
What, Hungary is not in the European Union?
They do what they want in their country.
And what happened to them?
Nothing.
So, if there is no problem in the EU?
In the Polish government.
Not in the Polish government.
In the Polish citizens, sir.
Because it is they who elect politicians who elect the Polish government, sir.
And those who protest and many other protesters who will protest, because it will be very, very bad, it will be worse and worse in the Polish economy, I repeat, for a long time.
The problem is in the lack of economic knowledge.
Where were those protesters? Farmers, carriers, miners?
Where were they during the elections?
Why didn't they ask questions?
And what is your economic program for these, for these and for these?
Because they can't ask these questions, because they don't understand how the economy works.
And then, of course, people come to power who say what people want to hear by voting.
They don't talk about the economy at all.
And if they do, it's so cosmic nonsense that I just want to cry.
Let them all go bankrupt.
Which is inevitable.
Because already in the transport industry, the margins they were driving on were really small.
Because again, this beloved Union, which everyone in the Kremlin also supported, that we should enter, the Union will be great, we will get money.
Wow, what money.
And Poland is paying gigantic money to be in the so-called Union.
And people who are not aware of how the Union works will be talking nonsense.
This is the essence of ignorance.
This is, you know, terrible for me.
That's why these things are not terrible, some companies will go bankrupt and so on.
It doesn't really matter.
It's even very good.
Because as I said and I will repeat today, the more people get hit in the back, the greater the chance that they will start thinking.
Something is probably wrong in this country.
But what is wrong?
Well, we are wrong, ladies and gentlemen.
This problem is in us.
Not in some magical, evil, EU government.
Not in our evil government, one after another.
I'm not saying, since the war, I really don't know, apart from the Polish government, any government that had any economic movements that were coordinated, logical, wise and pro-Polish.
People don't understand that politics is actually a different variety of the word economy.
That's why the problem is here, not in those protesting there, the boss, the driver or whoever else is protesting there or the farmers.
Mrs. Mariusz, let's go back to the protesting farmers in a moment. Now, I invite you to a break.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I heard in the Sejm the appearance of a new Minister of Finance
and, to be honest, before New Year's Eve I was in a champagne mood.
The minister is happy, because the economy at the end of the year has great indicators.
At least that's what he explained in the Sejm.
Inflation has fallen from almost 20% at the beginning of the year to 7% at the end.
The Złotówka is very strong, we were all surprised.
The Warsaw Stock Index has gone up, which means that investors are buying Polish companies' shares.
Are these reasons for satisfaction for the statistical Pole at the end of 2023?
Do you think that suddenly and for no reason it is great in Poland,
because someone announced that some indicators, which he usually calculates, are better?
The falling inflation indicators only mean that the level of currency devaluation is less dynamic.
The so-called strong Złotówka is a word often used in the media,
but not necessarily positive.
So, I will scientifically mention a few basic possibilities
that affect the strengthening of a given currency.
One - economic growth.
Let's face it, it's not our business.
The payment dependencies of Polish entrepreneurs at the end of October reached almost 10 billion zlotys.
69% of debtors are single-person economic activities,
i.e. so-called ordinary Poles.
It is them who are having a hard time.
Giants are usually doing quite well.
And it is they who are positively boosting statistics.
A million poor people have less than one typical rich man.
So the average will be quite good.
The industry is not doing well either.
New orders are falling under the government.
In November - 17.3%, in October - 12.1%.
And all this according to the GUS data.
Prices are rising, Poles are getting poorer, companies are falling,
we spend billions on Ukraine,
let's add the money we have to borrow, because we don't have any.
Let's look at another reason.
Higher interest rates in Poland can attract investors.
Because they are looking for higher rents and investments.
This higher interest can lead to an increase in demand for gold.
Such a need.
Therefore, for its so-called strengthening.
The so-called reference NBP level was raised from an absurd level of 0.1% to 6.75%
and maintained for the next several months.
If you looked at the chart for the last 20 years,
you would see the rates falling rapidly.
As I said, from an insane level, i.e. practically to zero.
Another reason.
The trade balance.
Positive, i.e. additional trade balance,
i.e. we send more, we earn more on sales than we pay for what affects us,
can also cause such a gold strengthening.
Let us remind you that in 2021 we had a negative balance
at the level of 7 billion,
when in 2020 it was additional and was 47.
Currently, after three quarters of 2023,
Poland has achieved an additional balance at the level of 9.5 billion.
This effect can be the result of a drop in import value.
This is what the data from the US Census says.
So if we look at it,
I don't see a reason for us to be delighted or happy.
Another reason.
Political and economic stability.
Let's face it, we're not the best example here.
The strength of gold also has its evident disadvantages.
Strong currency may be unfavorable for exporters,
because they become less competitive, they are simply expensive.
Low activity in this field weakens our economy in the long run.
Maybe it's slowly becoming more normal,
and you always emphasize that the economy needs normal,
stable conditions to develop.
You're right.
The best thing in the economy is normalization, stabilization.
I can't remember for many years that something like this has happened here.
Look at our auditions.
A threefold jump in fuel prices, coal prices.
This is not a normal economy, sir.
Mr. Mariusz, in our auditions,
we said many bitter words to President Glapiński.
Meanwhile, he predicted an inflation decline by the end of the year.
And yes, it's happening.
Shouldn't we pay him back the honor that his predictions were true?
I showed how little they know how to control inflation,
unfortunately.
In the end, inflation could not go on forever,
because, please note,
that it caused quite a lot of dissatisfaction.
Politicians base their decisions on public opinion,
on the satisfaction of their voters.
The last elections were proof of this.
That it is not allowed to piss off voters too much,
because access to power is over.
In addition, they have undertaken a lot of actions
that destabilize in order to distort these indicators a bit.
And should we be happy about it?
According to the data and analysis of this wonderful Glapiński,
who we are supposed to praise here today,
inflation at the level of 2.5% is the goal of the Central Bank.
And here we have three times that.
So someone is wrong by 300% and we are glad that he is a genius?
Well, because before that they were wrong by 700%, right?
Mr. Mariusz, our experts certainly did not predict such an increase in the value of the zloty.
At least no one has talked about it before.
I return to the reflection on what inflation is good about,
because it is very interesting.
When it comes to the economy, development,
the encouragement of the economy,
should inflation be close to zero?
Should it be maintained at some level safe?
In my opinion, the optimal for the economy is stabilization, not a leap, as I said.
What is good for the economy?
Price stability.
Entrepreneurs like stable prices.
This enables planning, forecasting costs, pricing.
High inflation is a big price uncertainty.
Next, financial costs.
Entrepreneurs use loans to better finance their business.
High inflation may lead to higher interest rates,
which increases costs, which negatively affects the business.
Next, inflation affects price flexibility,
because high inflation leads to greater price variability,
more difficult management, greater risk.
But of course it is worth noting that on the other hand,
there is something like deflation,
i.e. the opposite of inflation,
and this makes it very difficult to generate profits.
Therefore, when we talk about what the optimal level is,
you see that high inflation generally
in every aspect of business harms entrepreneurs.
But we must not switch sides.
The best, in my opinion, for business and retail,
is non-existent, i.e. zero inflation.
I emphasize, without going into deflation.
This is a very important point.
On the other hand, high inflation is extremely beneficial
for politicians, governments, banks and officials.
Let's wish ourselves zero or close to zero inflation in the coming year.
And this is the first conclusion from our hearing.
We invite you to the second conclusion after the break.
Mr. Mariusz, a moment of break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I read the first ""Farming"" website,
it's a website dedicated to agriculture.
Recently it described the backstage of
food import from Ukraine.
Because it's not only about grain,
which was talked about recently,
it's also about corn, chicken, vegetables.
After the outbreak of the war,
a year ago, the European Union set a zero-interest rate
for agricultural products from Ukraine.
And it turns out that
thanks to this, the Dutch company,
which has a company in Ukraine
with the oligarch,
brought to the Netherlands
about 700 chickens from Ukraine
per month.
In the Netherlands, he packed them and sent them
to the shops, also to Poland.
They cost 13 zlotys per kilogram,
while from the Polish farmer
they were 30% more expensive.
And it turns out that this lack of goals,
which was supposed to help Ukraine,
actually helps to earn money for the oligarchs
and the Western concern.
Do you want to see it?
Absolutely not. Such knowledge was available
only to a few,
and for most people it was
completely impossible.
And do you know why?
I don't know. If I knew, I would probably take such an interest.
Because it requires rejecting the media
and using your own intellect
in combination with logical thinking.
And it's as complicated
and non-existent in the minds of most of the knowledge
as history.
I suggest that one day you, just for fun,
will be able to make street polls
about the biggest and most well-known
historical events or figures.
I'll be honest, it's funny, but also scary.
No one predicted it.
And now, not many people know what's going on.
But we have authorities that should be
penetrative, have the required knowledge
and should predict such things
and avoid them.
The authorities predicted it and they knew it.
I'm absolutely sure of it.
Mr. Mariusz, there is something like
purchasing patriotism, i.e. buying your products
and selling them. Recent studies show that
Polish people, when shopping,
are now mainly guided by the price.
At least it became more popular
since inflation rose.
Purchasing patriotism and putting on your own products
has decreased by half.
And anyway, how to distinguish
Ukrainian chicken from Polish chicken?
Does it make sense at all
as a fight or a way to eliminate
unwanted phenomena?
It makes perfect sense.
If someone doesn't do it,
he won't cry and complain
because it's absolutely inevitable.
What you call purchasing patriotism
is not purchasing patriotism at all.
It's just a minimum of logical thinking.
You look at the river
that flows through your garden
and your neighbor's. Suddenly,
your neighbor digs so that your plot
and a place to help me dig.
And then you sit by the burnt ground,
dry, your neighbor is swimming
in this river, which is all his.
And now the question is whether taking care
of the river flowing through your plot
is some kind of patriotism
or just a minimum of human thinking.
What is water in this example?
Money, income.
Exactly. It is said in economics
that money flows are the blood
of the state.
So if you let the blood
from the Polish economy
through the financing of foreign companies,
then you are cutting your own veins.
People commit economic suicide,
so it's not patriotism at all.
It's just a self-preservation instinct,
sir. Let's see what's going on
in the world. Which countries are strong
and which are weak?
Those with a strong economy.
But where do they get their strong economy from?
Because this blood flows in their bodies.
You don't give blood to anyone else.
I don't know if you ever gave blood.
You were definitely taken blood,
but did you give it? And I don't know if you know
what happens to the body when you give
half a liter, a liter of blood.
What happens to the body?
Exactly the same with the economy, sir.
So you can let this blood
through and let's help
the poor Ukrainians a little bit. Okay, okay,
great. But you know,
we just cut our veins and someone
drinks our blood.
The so-called capitalist European
is joking here, of course, but you understand what I'm talking about.
Because this is again the communist jargon,
which shows the phenomenon,
but interprets it purposefully wrong.
It's not patriotism, sir.
It's just some kind of idiocy.
If we're talking about autism.
In the rescue, there is a rule that
you should save in such a way, but never in such a way
to pose a threat to the rescuer.
Bravo, bravo, bravo.
You see, wise rules are wise.
We can help, we can save,
but as you said, the most important rule
is that if I drown in it,
we both drown, and that's stupid.
I'll put it this way, I also sailed a little,
also at sea. When we had a storm at the Mediterranean,
Captain Uda said that
if someone falls out, we don't come back for him,
because in these conditions, with this crew,
he won't take such a risk.
A very young man, my friend,
a very nice man, very helpful,
kind, and so on, but at the same time,
a thinker, you know, sir, as if he knew the realities.
Listen, if I try in these conditions,
with this yacht, with this crew, to try to take someone out of the water,
we'll all die at 99.9.
End of the dot.
The chances of saving someone in this weather
are minimal, so what?
I'll kill a dozen people
so that I can save one?
It's just absurd.
Mr. Mariusz, we'll continue in a moment.
I invite you to the break.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I read the information from the office of credit information, which stated that we have a kind of ice age when it comes to housing loans.
In previous years, Poles took housing loans to the max, and now they don't take them.
As if they didn't want to build houses or buy apartments.
The data of this office show that the amount of loans has dropped to 30% of what we borrowed a year ago.
Development companies are already crying that they won't have anyone to build for in a moment.
However, I did not find any information anywhere that significant housing prices have dropped, which should probably happen in this situation.
We talked in August last year and you predicted a crisis in the housing market and you predicted a drop.
Will these drops occur?
So yes, let me disagree with these theses.
Poles want to buy apartments and want to borrow.
Banks stopped wanting to give them money.
Next.
According to the data I have, prices are falling for both apartments and rent.
Apartments.
For example, I will quote here.
Rent rates have dropped slightly after 10 months of continuous increases, according to the report of Expandera and Rentier.io.
In October, the rent was 9 out of 16 cities, 2 out of 16 rates did not change, and 5 out of 16 further increases were noted.
We read on.
Thanks to the drop in housing prices, the average rent of an apartment has increased to 5.54 net, which is equivalent to an apartment with a 6.84% rate.
So if you analyze the numbers on the market, it turns out that prices are falling.
Of course, if we look even deeper into the data, it will turn out that last year there were significant increases resulting from the gigantic inflow of millions of dollars.
Millions of refugees from Ukraine.
So all of this means that despite this abnormal system of things, because no normal country is able to accept several, as we said, 4 million officially Ukrainians who entered the Polish border,
it is not a normal situation in any country in the world.
And no real estate market could behave well in this situation, because it is an unhealthy, unnatural situation.
If, despite this, at the end of the year, and here I read the data literally from December 2022, it indicates that what I predicted would be, I remember even saying that it would make more or less sense,
the drops should be at the level of 30% of the value of the housing price.
That's what you said.
Yes, I remember that.
So if you look at the current data, where 4 million people have flown, i.e. people who have to live somewhere, and despite this, there are drops.
Of course, these drops are after the wave of increases. Why?
Because 4 million people have flown to live, to buy and rent apartments.
But despite everything, our market was totally unequal, that's why these prices have to fall. There is no way out.
If Ukrainians left, please believe me, what I predicted would be little to slow down the market crash now.
300% drops would not help. This is absolutely obvious to me.
You said that Poles want to take out loans and build apartments, but banks have stopped giving them.
Banks also have to adapt to the situation, for example, to inflation and the so-called reference rate set by the National Bank of Poland, which is high.
Loans have become expensive. Is this only the effect of inflation or are there other elements to it?
Inflation has nothing to do with it, to be honest. Inflation is a key word that is supposed to explain to people who have no idea about the economy, why it is bad in the economy.
One day we can do a whole hearing about inflation and I assume it will be an incredibly interesting experience for you,
when I will present you scientific facts, economic knowledge, a little deeper than what you hear, see and read.
If it's not inflation, then what is it?
The topic is very serious and deep, so it's hard for me to explain it in one sentence, so that listeners who are not economists can understand it.
In general, let's say it's an unhealthy market system and all of this is the effect of it.
It's like the effect of a disease that affects the Polish economy and the real estate market in particular.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
American billionaire Warren Buffett has been selling shares of stock exchanges he bought a few months ago.
What do you think? Why does he need the capital he concentrates on?
Is he preparing something new, a new venture?
Or maybe he's afraid of sudden losses in the stock exchanges and losses in the shares?
This is probably much more serious and means more than only listeners could deduce from Mr. Słup.
We are talking about someone completely unique here, the so-called ""Zomach's Whistle"", the ""legend of investment"",
about something that I don't remember in my life yet, that is, the compressing of his capital on a scale not seen.
Reason number one that comes to mind. The guy is crazy.
Well, he has his years, Mr. Warren Buffett is over 90 years old.
Yes, well, maybe something has changed in his brain and he's starting to do such strange things.
The second thing in his head is blackmailed in some unusual way.
Maybe he's in some crazy debt.
Maybe some woman has an influence on it.
These are the typical reasons.
Well, of course, you mentioned a different version.
You said that maybe he's predicting something, maybe he wants to run away with this money, shares,
and maybe for some reason he needs to have such a supply of cash.
I won't be able to talk for a few minutes and explain all the options,
but I can give you a summary and maybe some additional links, materials, for audycje.com.pl,
which is the initiative that we came up with together on the occasion of one of our auditions.
Mr. Marysia, let's go back to Warren Buffett,
because listeners need to understand the scale of the savings that the older gentleman has accumulated.
He didn't spend it, it's cash, it's capital that can be immediately disposed of.
How much did he collect?
We're talking about pretty serious money here.
As I quickly looked at his reports, which I give to the participants,
in the last quarter alone he sold shares worth 5.3 billion dollars in the last three months.
At the same time, he increased his cash by 10 billion dollars in the first half of the year.
It's like he's suddenly showing off right away.
He's practically adding 5 billion every three months.
That's how it would turn out.
We're talking about 10 billion in cash, but his capital is estimated at 7.6 billion.
In total, it's less than 1.5%.
But how much does he lose on it? What is the cost of withdrawing this money?
Because, you know, this money works for him.
And so I quickly calculated it.
We assume an average of 21% per year on our investments.
Earnings from invested capital, right?
Yes.
Inflation in the USA in September, calculated in CPI, was 3.7.
It turned out to me that it would give him about 60 million in costs of withdrawing quarterly.
So he has to think he'll make more.
Because if you take such a cost, it's about having to pay for it.
I quickly calculated it.
It gives 240 million such costs per year, plus what he normally gets from profits.
So another 50 million comes.
So he has to count on getting 300 million or more from the 10 billion he withdrew over the last few months.
Because, in fact, if you add up what he already had before, he currently has 157 billion dollars.
And this is, ladies and gentlemen, the largest his cash position in history.
Mr. Marysiu, but that's a lot of money. 150 billion dollars, times 4, is about 6.
Almost 700 billion.
And you know, that's more than the entire Polish budget.
So one person really has more money in his hand than we as a whole nation plan to have for the whole year.
Including the deficit, i.e. the debts we owe.
But he doesn't do anything with this money. He keeps it. And it seems to last for a few months.
What is he waiting for?
You know what? This is a question for a billion dollars.
It may be one of the scenarios I mentioned earlier.
But it may also be that he is planning some kind of investment.
For me, this is a clear signal.
He predicts that there will be a breakdown of the companies' notations.
Let's face it, there is no other logical conclusion I can draw as an economist from these actions.
Where a person does something unprecedented in the history of his business.
He is called a believer, a legendary investor, known for predicting various events.
Effective prediction.
But knowledge is knowledge, facts are facts.
Economy is economy, so you know, everyone can come to similar conclusions.
On a large scale or a minimal scale.
We see the same phenomena, only we have different possibilities.
But in this case, if there is going to be a crisis, why is it worth having cash with you in times of crisis?
Great question.
To make purchases, ladies and gentlemen.
The biggest crises, the biggest misfortunes are the biggest investment opportunities.
Art is based on at least two things.
Number one, on timing, meaning waiting for the right moment.
Because the difference between a good investor and a bad investor is sometimes only a few seconds, a few hours or a few days.
The second aspect is to estimate what we will invest in or what assets we will get rid of.
And this also distinguishes winners from losers.
For example, he invests a lot in government debt papers, which everyone has been running away from lately, on a massive scale.
He hopes that private companies will go down, but the value will be kept in government papers.
He assumes an economic collapse, but he does not assume the collapse of the government, some civil wars, etc.
Okay.
Nor will they conquer America.
Through China, for example.
This is not something to be afraid of.
I suspect it could indicate that he may hope for the other side.
It may turn out that he predicts that America will join some war, or that a war will break out and America will be in this war, but he will be on the side of the winners.
This is the subtle difference.
Mr. Mariusz, I invite you to take a break, but we will be back to the topic in a moment.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
This time I didn't hear anything, but I had the opportunity to experience it for myself.
Probably like many Poles, I recently got a discount on my annual energy bill.
Please imagine that I paid my bills well this year.
I was walking around the house, I turned off unnecessary bulbs,
and in the end it turned out that I have a very large addition to regulate.
And again I asked myself a question, which has already been asked at the beginning of our audition,
why is energy so expensive?
A year and a half has passed since the outbreak of the war with Ukraine,
and the markets should have calmed down,
and maybe they even calmed down, because some energy prices have fallen.
What's going on?
Because no meaningful or independent economic factors affect prices,
only politicians and business systems.
Legal or not, that's a different topic.
That's why I can document that prices in the world markets and how the global system of their production works
is actually one big price conspiracy.
I swear it's not even the slightest exaggeration.
Mr. Mariusz, but we see on our market that someone who burns coal
will buy this coal twice as cheap this year as the year before.
It's a fact.
70% of Polish energy is produced from coal.
It should somehow translate into a price drop.
The fact that coal prices are behaving like a yo-yo
is personally funny and terrifying to me.
How the hell is this happening?
The fact that for citizens prices have no connection with prices in the world markets
or the rules of the economy is just absurd.
All the most important prices are currently motivated politically, not economically.
The government is looking at how much they can afford to take money out of the pockets of citizens, taxpayers,
to satisfy the rich who finance these politicians,
whether through official money, like political campaigns,
or just small- or large-scale schemes with mega-rich people
who have an evident interest in building huge monopolies,
to launch price jumps.
Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that in the economy
you earn the most not when the economic situation is stable on a market,
but generally you earn the most when there are huge drops and increases.
Those who know about it or even prepare it have a recipe for success.
You can't lose on it when you know that a tax will come in
and you'll use it knowing that it will come in.
That's how the biggest fortunes of these super-rich people were created.
It's all the same stories, that these were government contracts,
that these were some schemes, that they were getting a monopoly on something.
So I'm just waiting for some scandal to come,
where it will be said clearly that all this was a scam.
I have no other word for something like that.
Mr. Mariusz, I'm going back to the question you raised.
Today, the energy payments made by the residents are 40 or 60 groszy per kilowatt.
Forecasts say that it will reach the zloty, so there are more increases waiting for us.
The payments that have now somehow eased the effects of these increases are to be liquidated.
In addition, there is inflation that hits us in the pocket.
What is the acceptable level that you mentioned?
How much can politicians afford to raise the energy price?
How much can we afford?
The answer is only one.
It's us who decide whether we want to be robbed or not.
As I said, there are no independent, economically conditioned factors
that would cause coal to jump 100%, 200%, 300% and then drop by 50%.
A mine is a super-stable thing.
You can't suddenly accelerate and slow down.
The same goes for the power plant.
You can't just stop it for an hour and then...
It's impossible!
It's technically impossible, ladies and gentlemen.
These are very long-term actions.
You can't suddenly increase, decrease, cut something here.
It doesn't work that way.
Everything you see is the effect of something that is a monopoly or an oligopoly.
A situation where either one or a few big ones rule everything.
Completely, totally everything.
Then, the clients have no influence on what's happening on the market.
That's why the only solution is to liquidate these monopolies and oligopolies
because it's too dangerous.
A greedy, greedy politician uses it to earn money
and then gives it to the oligarchs, the fuel, the economy, the arms, the pharmaceuticals.
We see it all with our own eyes.
We pay for it.
There's only one thing behind it.
The connection between the politician and the business.
An unclear, illegal connection.
It's obvious that these are not healthy, normal systems.
And as long as we allow it, it will be like that.
Politicians only look at people who are already mad enough.
People who were fed up with the masks and suddenly say ""We can tolerate it, from day to day!""
I can accept everything.
The masks, the stupidity, the distances, the plexiglass everywhere.
But I can't accept that from day to day someone suddenly refused it and it suddenly became dangerous.
I can't accept that.
And that's why politicians should be accountable.
That's evil for me.
The prices of fuel, coal, gas, and many others.
It's a tragedy that we look at it and say ""Okay, the fuel price has increased by 100%!""
How did it happen?
Time for a break. Listeners, I invite you in a moment.

What's up Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there?
I heard that the German government is inviting foreigners to Gerlitz.
It's a border town, so the offer is probably mainly for Poles.
And what do they offer in this Gerlitz?
Well, they offer a flat for the first two months.
Plus a free ticket to public transport for three months.
If someone offers me something for free, I'll immediately take a paw.
What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
Yes, it's really funny, but at the same time scandalously offensive for Poles.
They give us a bus ticket?
Let's see what they give to others.
For refugees from Ukraine, and there are over a million of them,
they give exactly the same privileges as German citizens,
but bigger than all other migrants.
A monthly allowance of 449 euros for each, and up to 400 euros for children,
depending on the age.
So a typical Ukrainian family gets several thousand euros per month for entry.
But that's not all.
The authorities pay for the costs of living, rent, heating and cold water.
They also have various aid activities for other bills, such as gas and electricity.
The government gave 4.4 billion euros last year to Ukrainians alone,
and additionally finances various social services for them.
And I also looked at the fact that only 9% of Ukrainians live in refugee centers,
3/4 live in private premises.
Almost 40% intends to stay forever, or at least for a few years.
I also saw the news of the Minister of the Interior,
who revealed that a large number of Ukrainian youth is being transferred to high crime rate.
Now there are officially almost 4,000 such crimes,
where there were several hundred cases in Germany before.
I encourage Poles to see the police statistics in Poland,
and I am surprised that Polish criminals are declining in the amount and brutality of crimes.
Mr. Maryszula, but this is help for refugees from a country engulfed in war.
In a sense, it can be understood.
But why invite and give such privileges to newcomers from Poland?
Why so much emigration for Germans?
Because there is no one to work with.
Perhaps this is a problem of eastern countries,
which for years, decades, were part of the GDR,
are delayed in relation to western Germany,
and it seems that after the merger, a large part of the Germans from the east moved to the west.
Does this problem concern the whole country, the whole Germany, or only the eastern part?
So yes, of course you are right that it was so after the merger with Germany,
and to this day, if someone travels through Germany and looks around carefully,
he sees that he was driving through two levels.
The poor level and the rich level.
The economy, the city, everything is poorer on the eastern side.
This is really the case to this day.
Of course, this is significantly blurred by all the decades that have passed since the merger.
It's true, but it's still visible to the naked eye.
The problem is not that it is historically poorer or historically richer.
The problem is that, as I said, there is no one to work in Germany.
According to my estimates,
percentagely in Germany, the least people work,
and the most income in the history of this country.
We officially know that the so-called refugees have been influenced by the multi-million Reich.
How can it be that many millions of young healthy people enter the country,
because I checked the statistics,
and the average refugee is 29.9, and the average German is 47 and something.
So this is a gigantic, crushing age difference.
Those refugees who came from the south-east are young, healthy, strong people.
And we are talking about multi-million Reich.
They were not able to provide the economy with the right amount of jobs.
As the German Internal Affairs Office officially states,
this is a gigantic multi-billion, as I remember, I summed it up once,
we are talking about tens of billions of euros spent on various kinds of subsidies.
Someone has to earn it.
The Germans can't. There are too few of them, there are old people,
this is a country of pensions and practically no children.
Who will work? Poles?
Who will work for a bus ticket?
When the Ukrainian family gets thousands of euros for free accommodation,
for the payments to the front.
This is offensive.
We will come back to the topic of German demographics and the demographic effects in Germany after the break.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear?
The economic services have recently been informed that Orlen, our largest national concern,
will take over the Puławy nitrogen group by the end of the year.
It is also the largest producer of agricultural fertilizers in Poland.
Interestingly, this is happening in a situation where the company with a very profitable income
has suddenly lost, and this is serious, last year it lost PLN 400 million.
Let's start with the explanation of where this loss came from.
The official explanation is that it is a double effect,
a mixture on the gas market, which is necessary in this production.
Is this a sufficient reason?
Indeed, this is a valid question.
I will add that they previously had a profit of PLN 882 million.
Jumping from such profits to such crushing losses is something to look at.
Officially, this is caused by high gas prices,
without a doubt by the mass flood of Poland through fertilizers and foreign-made materials.
But for me, this is just another media fable
and few people understand what is really behind it and what the consequences will be.
Putting everything on Putin has no economic justification.
This is primarily the reason for the EU policy and the ecomania that currently governs these bribed euro-idiots.
Mr. Mariusz, I will fall into your words.
The EU wants our agriculture to be ecological, healthy,
to use as little artificial fertilizers as possible,
which should reduce the demand for fertilizers.
And reducing the demand should reduce the price of fertilizers.
Is this the mechanism you are talking about?
You have made a good logical conclusion, but it has nothing to do with reality.
I will explain this.
To understand this, you should look at the entire geopolitical and economic structure of the world.
Fact number one.
Currently, in Asia and Africa, starvation is starting.
And I'm not talking about the previous poverty or starvation that has been there for decades.
No!
I'm talking about a completely new phenomenon.
I'm talking about a massive disruption of food production worldwide.
One of the reasons is nitrogen fertilizers.
Exactly what our pu'a and nitrogen fertilizers produce.
Market disruptions on fertilizers are an introduction to starvation.
Let me remind you, if you don't know, that Poland accounts for 2% of the world's export of these fertilizers,
and Russia and China for about 25%.
But what, there is no such fertilizers in the world?
Yes and no.
Let me just remind you what we said.
I once showed the whole mechanism to the listener, for example, fuel and coal.
Rapid leaps of several hundred percent, shocking shortages, gigantic speculations,
and then destructive long-term effects for the entire economy.
And all this for what reason?
Only political decisions, ideological and not economic reasons.
We have exactly the same thing now in the world of fertilizers, in the world of food production.
Only there were consequences that all companies will become poorer, because their costs will jump rapidly.
But here we are talking about the physical death of a gigantic number of people.
The facts are that in Poland and in the world, fertilizers are extremely expensive.
And this crazy, among others, EU policy wants to change it for the eco.
Only there is no economic justification for this.
But then why does Orlen buy a company that has financial problems and whose development opportunities are perhaps under a lot of question?
It would actually seem that Orlen buys it from an economic point of view.
And they explain it this way, that the extension of their distribution chains is the production of various chemical substances.
Orlen does not necessarily have to buy it for logically, economically justified reasons.
This answer undermines two assumptions in this whole system.
Three years ago Orlen bought regional, local press publications. And it was not under the influence of profit, but under the slogan of repolonization of the media.
Perhaps in the case of nitrogen, it is also about maintaining the Polish character of this or other companies that LOTOS has taken over.
Maybe, I don't know what's in the minds of politicians, I can only analyze economic facts.
I know for sure that consolidations give gigantic, monopolistic profits.
And they are needed by politicians to buy voters for money from their own pockets.
Another sick initiative with a rise of 500+ to 800+.
What's funny, when I read the data, most Poles are against it.
I am glad that people are becoming more and more economically conscious.
And I hope that our auditions, to some symbolic, albeit to a degree, also help in this.
In this case, I propose that we move on to the next part of our audition.
A short break.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I was shocked by the fuel distributor.
And probably not only me.
In a few days, the price of a liter of gasoline
and diesel oil
dropped by about 40 cents, as far as I remember.
Does this have any economic justification, Mr. Mariusz?
What's going on in the world's oil exchanges?
Or maybe the government
suddenly lowered the fuel prices?
Oil prices are going up.
Taxes and excise taxes are the highest
for many years.
And prices are going down.
Interesting, surprising.
Everyone is asking why.
Maybe we remember the situation during the pandemic,
when fuel was so cheap
because people didn't buy it,
because they didn't drive, there was no need.
Maybe we have a similar situation,
that the demand has dropped.
The only logical reason
is what is the main line
showing the basis
of all economic decisions in the economy.
And not only in Poland.
Politics and ideology.
Elections are coming up.
So the price increases
would not set voters positively.
Low prices?
Definitely yes.
Of course, we are talking about people
who can only look at the length
of their own nose and have Alzheimer's
and don't remember what happened yesterday.
So they are perfectly voters.
So we will lower the fuel prices
for a few months.
Or anything else.
Coal, gas, apartments.
We will give preferential loans.
And they will forget
that all the things I mentioned
have jumped up several times
in recent years.
For me as an economist,
it is literally a cheek,
such price jumps.
And it has nothing to do with the economy.
It's pure politics.
I remember how fuel was getting more expensive.
One of the arguments from Orlen,
who basically decides about fuel prices in Poland,
was that fuel in Poland
cannot differ from the price levels
in Europe, because we will have
pathological situations,
that it will be bought, exported.
It is just that we live in the border zone
and we see crowds of Czechs
who come to us to refuel.
From what the media show,
along the German border, the situation is the same.
There are even stations that have introduced
a limit on the amount of fuel
that can be refueled.
Only 100 liters.
And what about the reserves?
Can it somehow surprise our market?
No, I don't think it will surprise the market.
Because, as I said,
according to my knowledge,
it is a temporary situation,
so it doesn't matter much.
But of course,
first of all, the excuses were absurd.
That fuel in Poland must be as expensive
as in Europe.
This is a total lie.
It doesn't matter.
There are methods to shorten
the time of refueling,
so we have to burden our citizens
as high as the richest countries
in Europe.
An idiotic idea,
having nothing to do with the economy.
So it was just an excuse.
Orlen is a public company,
so it has the highest profits
in history.
Because we paid the highest fuel prices.
Of course, these false excuses
that they don't make better money on fuel.
In some auditions, I remember,
I explained how it's done.
Formally, it doesn't make money on it,
but in fact, it makes billions.
Here we have, on the other hand,
an idiotic play.
From the point of view of the economist,
I say, of course, idiotic.
For the government, it's a brilliant play.
When I look at the Germans or Czechs
standing in the queues for fuel in Poland,
I swear I'm itching my teeth.
If our prices were set
thoroughly, we would be happy.
Yes, it's great,
we have profits, we sell more,
we earn more.
Great.
But I don't think so at all
that these prices should be set economically,
in reality.
It's just another electoral sausage
we've seen so many times,
and people with a maniac's stubbornness
erase the memory
that every government does the same,
and then everything goes back to normal.
So again these increases,
again the scandal, and so on.
I'll quote one of the publications
I've read recently.
""The Czechs have probably the worst government
in history.
There is not a single economist in the government.""
End of quote.
For me, it's a pathology of so-called democracy
that everyone is ruled by people
who know nothing but talking,
that is, politics.
And suddenly it comes to such an absurdity
that a great Czech economy,
because the Czechs had a very good economy,
much better than the Polish economy,
suddenly it turns out
that one absurd government is enough.
And the Czechs see it.
They protest.
The society is really very upset there.
They are right.
But I'm surprised that the Poles
accept the government
of people who know nothing.
Let's take a look at all these people
who are at the top
and tell me what they can do
so really, what they have shown in their lives.
They did something,
they created something.
In most cases, when I look through the lives
of these people, I want to laugh.
They are just some officials
from the political field,
great-aunts or descendants
of some officials or SB officers.
And these are the so-called resort children.
How are they supposed to rule well?
""Mr. Marysia, you don't appreciate the Polish government,
obviously, but the Czechs who come
to us for shopping complain about their own,
but praise us because they have it cheap.
So maybe this is a sign
that our government is good.""
Great, you said it.
So maybe let's explain that the Polish government
is good for the Czechs.
It is one of the best governments
for the Czechs,
which is theoretically the Polish government.
It is also the best government for the Ukrainians,
being theoretically the Polish government.
It is also the best government for the Germans,
being the Polish government.
And suddenly it turns out that
our governments are brilliant
for all the nations around
except for the Poles.
I invite you to take a break.
We'll be back in a moment.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
German company Wisman, very well known on our market for years,
has been building a heat pump factory in Legnica for a year.
It spent 200 million euros on it, so the investment is serious.
A few years ago, the heat pump was not in our homes.
Today, there are 320,000 of them installed,
and hundreds more are installed in new buildings.
The price of the heat pump has skyrocketed.
Today, it's 30,000 zlotys without installation.
It's basically a gold mine.
Meanwhile, the strangest thing is that Wisman sold itself
to the American company Central Global.
What's the point?
Yes, let's think about it.
I'll add that this is not an exceptional case,
but a part of a bigger picture.
But first, let's take a look at some facts.
One. We know that the officials at the highest levels of power are bribe-takers.
Two. We know that there are multinational, national,
and mega-corporations that have unimaginably large amounts of money.
Three. Most people never check what they are told.
Four. People are sensitive to emotional and well-sounding things,
like security, the environment, the future of children, and so on.
Five. Most mega-rich people have small or even no scruples
when they can earn more than they currently have.
Since we have a few facts, we can move on to the analysis of your question.
At the same time, officials around the world have begun to introduce regulations
that care for the environment, our health, and the future of children.
And quite by accident, this is the best business for one or more world giants
who have patents, money, and production facilities
for one or more technologies necessary to meet these regulations.
A classic example, one from our backyard,
the Climate Package 2020.
It was invented in 2007 and introduced in 2009.
It assumed a cut of 20% of greenhouse gas emissions,
an increase of 20% of renewable energy sources,
and a 20% increase in energy efficiency.
This is brilliant for an industry that has literally never existed before.
I was not even able to find data on the existence of heat pumps in Poland in 2010,
and sales data, and so on.
It was just some non-existent, symbolic, individual things.
Now, let's talk about heat pumps.
I will remind you of a few facts again.
Heat pumps have existed for over 200 years and date back to Kelvin,
this Kelvin from the degree.
In 1852, the possibility of using a heat pump for heating was already known.
In 1912, a patent was made for ground heat pumps.
And there is such a patent issued. It's a Swiss patent.
- 100 years ago.
- Over 100 years ago.
In the 1930s, heat pumps were already being used in a continuous and daily manner.
And nothing.
There was no explosion, there was no mega-business.
These were scandalous little things.
In 2010, 6,500 all types of heat pumps were officially sold in Poland.
And in 2022 - 200,000.
You see, after the introduction of the regulations of this climate package,
suddenly a few thousand appeared.
How much will you earn on these few thousand heat pumps if you are a mega-rich man?
Nothing.
But for 200,000, it's like this.
And it's really gigantic.
If you look at the charts of the industry development, it's just a peak.
This is only the golden business.
This is just the beginning of this Eldorado.
And now you understand that if we combine all the things I said earlier,
that is, that the officials are bribe-takers, we know that,
that rich companies even finance campaign of politicians and officials on various levels,
to get the right positions,
and that something that once did not exist before the introduction of the regulations,
suddenly shot up after the introduction of these regulations,
which were introduced by officials who were financed,
I'm not saying that everyone, I'm not saying that everyone, I'm not saying that always,
but enough a lot and at sufficiently high positions to change the face of the world.
So I hope that answers the question,
why yes and why even bigger, a giant bought a very large company.
And I invite you for a moment of break. We'll be back to the subject.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I got information from the United States.
In Los Angeles, shops are closing, because there are so many attacks with weapons that the staff of the shops is afraid of their lives.
In New York, on the other side of America, 55,000 robberies occur annually.
What's going on in America?
It's even more interesting than it seems, because now it doesn't even attack shops, it just goes in and takes what it wants and no one bothers it.
Moreover, the official policy of most large networks is to fire employees who interfere with the theft.
Well, it's absurd.
No, it's not absurd as long as you understand the mentality of America, the current ideology and the current regulations.
Those employees are doing the right thing, who do nothing, right?
Yes. If you don't bother in any way, let's face it, people don't attack, they just stabbed, but rather about dark skin color.
And that's why the media can't talk about it, because it will be racism suddenly.
But the facts are brutal, no one is discussing it anymore, you just can't talk about it, because how is it?
It's called racial profiling. And until now it was criticized and criticized, so in some cities the police just stopped arresting dark-skinned people, regardless of it, I don't know, they were walking behind a bloody machete, the policeman just turned around.
Well, because it would be suddenly that he is a racist.
The famous George Floyd, who was an actor in porn movies, a thief, a convicted criminal, beat women in pregnancy and suddenly he has a monument in the United States.
In my opinion, this was the highest point that the United States has found when it comes to this racial ideology, where for them the glorification is what political, sexual or dark-skinned views you have.
It was number one so far. And the Americans tolerated it for literally decades. But it's over.
Marysia, as you noticed, it is really difficult to find any information about what is happening inside America in Polish media.
However, on YouTube you can find recordings of Poles living in the United States or traveling around America.
And in their reports, the situation in the country is not happy.
For us it is important, because it is our main ally, in fact, a state that guarantees our security.
What is happening with the economic power of America?
Of course, the United States is in a bad state, and this is literally in every aspect - social, moral, financial, and even military.
The United States is deprived of any real fighting force today, due to the absurd policy towards Ukraine and what the United States is doing now.
What, the whole weapon was sent to Ukraine?
No! They simply don't have ammunition. They got rid of not only the ammunition they had, but also the ammunition they had from their so-called ""iron reserves"" in case of a conflict.
This is not to be said. Now it has come out in the United States, that's why it's a small affair.
Because it suddenly turns out that if a tiny state started a war with the United States, the United States can throw apples after a few days.
Sometimes the situation is so fatal that replenishing the reserves takes them 8 years, sir, to reach their reserves, which they had before the conflict in Ukraine.
They have no supplies. I saw comparisons, for example, of the war in the Bay of Britain, the famous Great War in the Bay of Britain.
You know that the number of missiles they used in the whole war in the Bay of Britain is now practically used for several days in Ukraine.
They would not be able to fight with such a Saddam Hussein in any case now. They would have nothing.
Putin can lead this war for years. And that's it.
The United States simply runs out of supplies, even the iron reserves.
It just came out. They were hiding it. It was like ""Oh, that's how we send it, okay, everything is fine, but you have an endless bag of missiles there, and it's super expensive and complicated.""
We don't have anything like that, so where do you get it from?
We take it out of our iron reserve in case of a conflict. Very brave, not to say stupid.
Economy. We could devote dozens of auditions to the economy of the United States, one by one, laying out the factors, first, how bad it is in the United States.
But let's mention, for example, the real estate market, which is in a slump again, as it was in 2008.
The indicators are fatal. The whole market is practically in a similar situation as then.
The entire financial market, the US debt structure is fatal.
More money printing, which are useless.
Again, the biggest reason for concern for Americans, i.e. the largest corporations that have been those cows to others, bringing gigantic profits,
now practically all of them are losing money.
We are talking about those mega Disney corporations, etc., which were the support of the economy, they gave many jobs.
Please note what happened last year.
We are talking about tens of thousands of layoffs from the richest corporations.
Of course, I will surprise you, this trend is still there.
It is not so loud anymore, but unfortunately layoffs are still there.
And another thousands of people are going to the slums.
These are already terrifying numbers when it comes to the United States.
Because who goes to the slums?
The best educated people, from the best corporations, the middle class, and who comes for it?
We are talking about millions of illegal immigrants, who literally are sleeping on the streets of cities,
they are burning fireplaces, breaking windows in shops, robbing shops, attacking normal working people.
And this is now the image of the US economy.
Not so beautiful, let's admit.
Mr. Mariusz, we will also take a break for a moment.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
The European Commission, such information appeared in mid-January, agreed that food producers could add flour.
Flour from ground homemade croutons.
For bread, for pastries, for cakes, even for pizzas.
Do you think this is the future of the world or not?
I still remember the era of Gierka, who launched that instead of meat we would eat an oceanic wing,
which is also a kind of shellfish.
Are we going back to this idea and abandon it or will it stay with us forever?
In my opinion, this is another reflection of the same art.
Lenin attacks.
Please note that the people behind us are the same people who are now exposed to the biggest corruption scandals,
the biggest scandals of incompetence, sexual scandals.
These are exactly, physically, the same people.
These are the same elites. Nothing has changed.
But maybe we are really facing the problem of food shortages in the world and hunger.
Hunger accompanies us, we try to somehow make it work.
Can't we feed people in the world with traditional methods?
With the data I have, I know that there is overproduction of food in the world.
From other data I know that every now and then a child dies of hunger.
Now please put these two facts together.
Well, it's a tragedy that we can't distribute this food around the world,
or we can't make it available at prices that are available to everyone.
No, it's definitely not like that.
In my studies I had subjects like logistics,
I even gave lectures on logistics and business training.
So I have a little bit of an idea about this topic.
And I say with full conviction.
We can distribute any products, including food, around the world.
We can do it very efficiently, we can plan it well,
so it's definitely not an obstacle.
Well, maybe some parts of the world just can't afford high-processed and expensive food.
And here's the problem.
Maybe you can give a part of the world that you say is dying of hunger and can't afford it.
For example, Africa is dying of hunger.
Sudan.
And now, again, I invite you to the library
and check where the largest deposits of valuable minerals are.
You will always end up in Africa.
These are the richest countries in the world.
Historically, I know that the countries that are now terribly destroyed,
poor, are the so-called countries of the third world,
but they were countries that used to be leaders in terms of wealth.
You mean natural wealth?
What is in the ground, right?
No, no, I'm talking about the wealth that they lived very well, they were rich, etc.
That's what I'm talking about.
Because for a country to be poor, it really has to have one thing.
It must have very valuable natural resources.
And this is the recipe for poverty.
Well, it would seem that this is the recipe for success, for wealth.
I'll give you an example.
You live in a town.
And at this point you have a rich neighbor,
he has a beautiful wife, a beautiful garden, a beautiful car.
And now what will happen when a group of very well-armed people
will be close to each other?
What will happen? Let me tell you.
Well, a rich neighbor is a potential target of an attack.
Exactly.
Poor - no.
Because from the rich you can steal a lot,
from the poor, unfortunately, he will kill you, but there is no money from it.
This is the whole problem.
That most countries, including Poland, which is very important,
we have gigantic, incredibly valuable natural resources.
We are one of the richest countries in Europe, if you didn't know.
I could talk here, we sat here for an hour
and I would talk about the resources in which we are the leader.
For example, geothermal.
We have one of the best geothermal power plants in Europe, sir.
I don't know if in the world, because I don't have a map,
but the maps I had are probably lying on the shelf somewhere.
We are the absolute leader.
We are just a world phenomenon.
In many areas.
Especially in the areas of food production.
There are many areas that we have been and are and can be the European leader,
certainly in some parts even worldwide.
That's why there is a problem.
But then what you said, it's better to be poor than rich.
No.
It's better to be rich, sir, and strong.
And then, if you have a rich, strong neighbor, no one will attack him.
Why? Because they would attack a rich and weak neighbor.
If two people with a gold necklace on their necks were walking down the street,
one would be a bull, the other a chubby.
Who would they attack, sir?
The weaker one, of course.
True.
Old law of nature.
I don't know if you know, but in nature it is so,
that predators never attack the most fertile, tasty pieces in the herd.
Never.
Never, ever.
Do you know who they attack?
Natural selection is that they attack the weakest, the victims that are easiest to catch.
Exactly.
Wounded, sick, weak, young.
We should give the listeners a moment of respite and come back to our conversation in a moment.

What is being played Mr. Mariusz?
And what did you hear there again?
I checked several forecasts, such as the one from the year before, which were set for 2022 and few of them turned out to be prophetic.
Well, for example, the inflation forecast. Even the president of the National Bank of Poland was wrong.
This is probably quite typical. Why else would it be?
Because he is an expert.
Yes, some say so, but I say that there is a lot of pressure on most of the experts I know from most of the areas I have contact with.
Even financial influence cases are documented on the position, opinion or decision of experts.
And this should not be a shock to anyone.
Before we get to the topic, it is worth introducing our guest, and he is and will be our weekly guest, Mariusz Stefaniak.
A man who connects many fields, both as a practitioner and as a theorist.
Economist, financialist, manager, among other large IT companies, marketing specialist, and most of all, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
Let's pay attention to the name - ""Więcej Mądrości"".
Every week we will meet regularly and talk about the economy and the complexity of the world.
Good morning, Mr. Mariusz.
Hello, I bow.
Let's get back to the topic.
An example of such missed forecasts is the housing market.
It was supposed to develop infinitely, prices were supposed to rise, demand was supposed to rise, and here it suddenly turns out that not so much.
Yes, this is a beautiful example.
Why, in this case, were these forecasts so optimistic?
The answer is only one, because you earn money on it.
Please note that the real estate market is one of the most profitable markets in the world.
Developers earn, landowners earn, good business.
Governments earn, sir, this is probably the most important.
A great example, for example, such an extreme, but the largest in the world, are China.
Someday we can talk about it in detail, I will show the whole mechanism.
I assume a shocking mechanism for the majority.
For me, a completely standard thing in this industry.
I will save topic number one for the next edition.
But we also have the cryptocurrency market, which has grown incredibly and it seemed that it would also grow all the time.
Yes, the forecasts were amazing.
I remember forecasts that said that in 2022 Bitcoin would cost 120, 140, 150 thousand dollars.
How much does it cost today? Easy to see.
The mechanism itself, ladies and gentlemen, and it is easy to notice a certain scheme.
Because you earn great money on it, on spinning something that we can safely call speculative banks.
But someone goes, someone on the other hand buys, agrees, accepts these prices.
So what, on the one hand we have stout players, and on the other hand a herd of sheep that go wherever they are told?
Exactly, you are doing great.
This is how you can emphasize all events in the history of the world.
Sheep go to slaughter, and the shepherd benefits from it.
But let's get back to the topic of experts who predict.
And not always, or rarely, do they hit with these predictions.
Do we have bad experts or do we have experts who work for someone's order, not necessarily those who listen to them?
We definitely have good experts in the world and they are brilliant people, great specialists.
But in a completely strange context, these are not the people who are most liked and promoted by the government, the media or large corporations.
They cannot break through with their message to the mass media, to public information.
Yes, because this message warns the sheep that they are going to slaughter.
The shepherd cannot like such a message, please forgive me, no shepherd will agree with someone who warns the sheep before entering the slaughterhouse.
Well, because they will rebel.
Or they will go the other way, because it suddenly turns out that the shepherd cannot handle hundreds of thousands of sheep at once.
Unless the sheep will follow the sheep that leads them.
Mr. Marysia, but maybe we live in very unpredictable times, maybe we just couldn't predict the war and the attack of Russia on Ukraine.
Well, the facts say otherwise, sir.
The facts that have been documented above all doubts are that at least 7 months earlier, the largest governments had 100% certain data on the attack.
What will it be, how will it be, where will it be.
These are the facts. It has even been published.
It did not get to the public opinion.
It did, you just have to know where to read.
At this point, we will take a short break, we will be back after a moment of music.

What's going on Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I've been reading last year's economic publications, articles right after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine,
which reported the effects of economic sanctions imposed by the West on Russia.
Right after the sanctions were introduced, it was written that they would actually cause a rapid decline in the Russian economy.
Half a year later, the narrative changed a bit. For example, CNN admitted last August that the sanctions had not yet worked.
But they haven't worked yet.
But in fact, the economy in Russia is declining, only slowly, and eventually it will decline.
Today we are a year and a half after the outbreak of the war.
From what I checked in the economic data in Russia, this year the growth of the domestic product Brutto was recorded.
What's going on Mr. Mariusz? Why aren't the sanctions working?
You know what? There are two options.
Either it's a miracle, or the media is just telling us nonsense.
There are similar lies told to us everywhere at the very beginning.
As soon as the Russian troops are destroyed, they run away, they surrender en masse, they have no equipment,
and we just wait for a quick victory of Ukraine.
It was a year ago.
I look at the front line and well...
It reminds me of what three things are most important for effective war.
Money, money and money. It seems Napoleon said so.
Exactly.
And today I would like to look at these three things from the point of view of war.
Let's start with a few facts.
Russia is the sixth power in the world and the fourth in Asia in terms of purchasing power.
It is included, which is important, in developing economies.
2. The Russian economy has a great potential for growth,
even if it has the largest resources of natural resources in the world.
3. Oil and natural gas in Russia are produced without so-called quotas,
i.e. imposed by the OPEC.
It has such great consequences for the entire economy and for our lives that you don't even suspect it.
4. Russia is one of the three, and recently it was the largest, oil producer in the world.
5. Russia is the largest exporter of conventional heavy weapons in the world.
And it is about 20% of all jobs in the industrial sector.
War is not able to harm the Russian industry, because they live on it.
Mr. Mariusz, there are some indicators.
For example, the Money.pl portal in mid-August this year,
which is quite recently, reported that the Russian currency is weakening,
that the Russian state's budget deficit is growing and inflation is growing.
These are some indicators that the economy is not good, it is not doing well.
Gazprom, according to the calculations I saw, has greatly reduced the level of profits it has achieved this year.
Isn't that a result of sanctions?
Would you like the state to have better indicators during the war than without war?
After 2014, half of the total foreign debt to the reserve currencies fell in Russia.
This showed that the state has become less dependent on foreign finance and on the international financial system.
It is one of the last economically independent countries in Europe,
from the economic financial mafia, because I have no other word,
which is above the governments, above the law.
They tell the governments what to do.
So Russia is currently independent and is one of the largest economic forces in the world.
In addition, 80% of exports are mineral and wood-based raw materials.
Russia has one of the smallest public debt indicators in the world.
This means that practically as one of the few, it can really afford it, it can manage.
It has smaller amounts, but it has, as I said, compared to its neighbor.
The neighbor has a nicer car, a nicer house, but all on credit.
In a situation when it gets bad, I don't know, both of you will lose your jobs.
Who will have it worse? Such simple questions for you.
Well, the loan will probably be due to the neighbor who has better looking things.
This is exactly Russia and the USA.
The USA is this ""rich neighbor"" who is just terribly indebted.
It's amazing how Russia is practically economically independent.
It has the money it has and the money it spends it really has.
Well, maybe the reason for all this is that Russia has not been able to effectively isolate itself from the very beginning.
There is a whole group of countries that trade with Russia.
Maybe that's why these economic penalties don't work.
You know what, maybe let's say one word that will change everything.
BRICS.
Which, in fact, no one says, no one writes about, and certainly does not show this phenomenon in the right scale.
This is a new union, only such an international union and a union of real interests.
They founded it, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
Now it has joined a few new countries.
We are talking about the fact that these are countries that are actually producing something.
And not only are they intermediaries, traders, speculators, who pump their gigantic budgets through financial operations, i.e. operations in the computer, to put it shortly.
There is nothing there that would really stand behind this, behind this power.
Probably a new currency will be created soon, which you probably don't know yet, but if you do, it will be too late.
Soon the dollar will cease to be, it is already ceasing to be the most important currency in the world.
Russia has prepared well for the war, ladies and gentlemen.
They have gigantic foreign exchange reserves.
Russia has 2,300 tons of gold.
Officially, I assume they have much more.
Let's add to this, ladies and gentlemen, the gigantic political and business influences in Africa.
Do you remember this Prygorzyn's death, his death recently, and so on?
This is much, much more, much deeper.
Among other things, it is about gigantic amounts in Africa, among other things, in various types of mines, refineries, where Prygorzyn, through his companies, had several dozen percent of the shares, giving him billions of income.
Now, of course, people are taking over Putin, and not only are they taking over, they are rapidly expanding their influence on subsequent countries.
And those who had shares and influence are still increasing them.
Africa is one of the richest continents when it comes to resources.
Russia is gaining, increasing its power, increasing its military strength.
Similarly, since the outbreak of the war, the Russian forces have not diminished, they have grown rapidly.
The amount of military equipment has not decreased, it has grown.
That's why I say, it's terrifying when I look at these media reports and how many people are being caught, deceived.
Mr. Matiusz, I invite you to a moment of break, we will continue our conversation in a moment.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear from us again?
On February 14, the European Parliament approved a directive, according to which very soon, because by 2035 in the EU countries it will be impossible to buy and sell combustion cars.
I am personally very used to my car for gasoline and I wonder if it can be avoided somehow.
Are we simply doomed to this decision or will we manage to avoid it somehow?
The answer will certainly be found in a way how to do it. My only question is why these prohibitions?
Well, what do you mean why? So that we live in a clean, ecological world, so that everyone is more comfortable and better.
It sounds nice, like all communist fairy tales, but like all communist fairy tales, it contains fundamentally false assumptions.
The assumption is that electric cars are ecological. It's a lie.
Well, they don't emit fuel.
Not true. They emit a lot of fuel, but not directly. It's like your smoking stove, a terribly smoking stove, with a clever bypass, led to the neighbor's garden.
And suddenly, look, I have a clean, non-emission stove. Nothing is flying out of my chimney. Pay me more. I'm a genius.
You mean energy production, right?
Not only. At practically every stage of electric car production, electric car use, electric car utilization, we make a crushing mess of the natural environment,
while stealing people from a gigantic amount of money.
Because combustion cars are well known, they are already relatively easy to repair.
You can't repair an electric car. You can't have a mechanic repair an electric car.
Because you need special high-voltage equipment, which almost no plant has, and it's not that easy to have them.
This will practically exclude the vast majority of all people who would like to repair something in their car, repair it themselves, at a low cost.
In electric cars, it is impossible. You need to have electronics, special diagnostic systems, you can't just replace parts, because it's complicated and dangerous.
It can literally, physically kill you. Your diesel engine won't kill you. Unless you fall on your head.
Electric cars can burn you in the garage. Electric cars are super dangerous for users.
Super expensive to maintain for users when it comes to repair costs.
It's a bag without a bottom, to put it shortly, in the current system. But this is just a tiny part of the problem.
A few days ago, I was listening to an interview with the director of Greenpeace Poland.
He was asked about the limited number of combustion cars. He answered the question that we have no other choice than to produce electric cars to live healthy and safe.
Mr. Mariuszku, let's consider the ecological consequences of the whole operation of moving to electric cars.
In the full range, it is impossible. So I will only show two simple mechanisms.
One, that is, the production of batteries for electric cars, which are the most important and most expensive element, with a total of 35 to 80% of the value of the whole car.
And the second, the powering of electric cars.
So, I read a nice report of Swedish scientists who studied the impact of electric hybrid cars on the environment, compared to combustion cars.
And, for example, the report shows that the production of lithium-ion batteries is associated with a high carbon dioxide emission.
Every 1 kWh of battery capacity is an emission of 150-200 kg of gas.
So, the bad gas, let's say.
For example, when buying a Nissan Leaf or Tesla Model S, we have a total emission of 5.3 tons, in the case of Tesla - 17.5 tons of carbon dioxide.
At the moment of buying. Swedish scientists also calculated that to emit as much carbon dioxide as it hits during the production of the battery,
an ordinary car would take almost 3 years, in the case of such a Nissan, in the case of Tesla - over 8 years.
And we say this only in the case that you buy a used battery, do not replace it, and so on.
Because when you buy a second-hand battery, it suddenly turns out that you have to drive a regular combustion car for 16 years,
to compensate only for the production of the battery itself, for the electric car, this super-eco.
I hope that this helped answer the question.
Exactly. To produce a battery for an electric car, you need many, many kilograms, even tens of kilograms of rare metals.
Are we able to produce as many rare metals as possible on Earth? And at what cost?
I am an economist, so I will answer as an economist.
If I see that some great development of the industry depends on something very difficult to achieve,
and only in a few places in the world, controlled by a few entities in the world,
then I feel a great tragedy for customers.
Because it will lead to a monopoly.
That is, there will be a few people, physically, who will control the entire industry of electric cars around the world.
And they will be able to dictate any conditions, even financial ones.
This is not a good future.
Certainly not for customers, but for producers, for suppliers.
See you in a moment.
A short break.

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
I heard, or rather read, that in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre
artificial intelligence wrote local law.
Specifically, a resolution on water measures that the councilors could not come up with.
One of the city councilors, Chata GTP, was given such a task.
In general, it was about obliging the local water supply plant to quickly install new water measures.
Because there is a plague in this city with water measures theft.
Artificial intelligence proposed such a record that
the waterways have 30 days to install a new water measure after the theft.
Because if they don't do it, they simply don't have the right to collect water fees.
Brilliant and simple, Mr. Mariusz. Why didn't man come up with it?
In one sentence, I will explain to you that these are completely different worlds
with different objectives and different goals.
On the one hand, artificial intelligence is not any intelligence,
but advanced, self-learning mathematical models
aimed at searching for the best results in the shortest time with optimization methods.
On the other hand, the activities of the authorities are the exact opposite.
It is about increasing the degree of complication,
extending the time and costs of action.
Political or official actions have completely opposite effects
than one might expect from people who think logically.
And this example with water measures is so interesting,
maybe it would be a good idea to ask yourself the question
why is there such a problem at all?
Why don't we have such mass thefts?
Why? Because there is a fatal government, a fatal economy,
people are poor, politicians are corrupt,
and no artificial intelligence can fix anything.
So it was easier for us to invent artificial intelligence
than to reprogram the way the administration, offices and politicians act, right?
Yes, exactly. You are right.
It is easier to generate the most advanced self-learning models
than to elect honest politicians.
Mr. Mariusz, but this resolution in the city of Porto Alegre was approved by the City Council
and only after that, after this fact, the councilor who asked for the proposal of artificial intelligence
betrayed, publicly said that it was she who prepared the project and the resolution.
Does it mean that we are ashamed to use artificial intelligence in such cases?
Not at all. It depends on who and how uses it.
Artificial intelligence is just a tool.
New, efficient, if you can use it, let's add.
In the past, computers, calculation arcs or text editors were such a leap.
Until now, computers have handed us over to tedious, laborious work,
and now they are starting to hand us over to creative work.
This is a bit of a shame, at least for some.
No, no, I will not agree with that.
There have been a lot of such loud cases,
for example, of undereducated or lazy lawyers or programmers using AI or SI,
as we can shorten it in Polish.
It happened that the official American legal committee
issued special detailed guidelines describing and prohibiting the use of artificial intelligence.
And so do many of the richest companies, also computer companies,
prohibit their employees from using artificial intelligence under serious sanctions.
Mainly for two reasons.
One, of course, is the security of data,
because artificial intelligence is just a big machine for stealing data.
And the second, to potentially dangerous errors that can be caused by using artificial intelligence.
Such thoughtless use.
One of the largest electronic companies in the world, Samsung Semiconductor,
officially allowed the use of GPT chart,
and here I will quote the journalist from the portal DobreProgramy.pl.
Samsung engineers used the GPT chart,
among other things, to create quick source code corrections,
pasting it in the application, which meant leaking data outside the company.
The company has reported three cases of using artificial intelligence in a way
that led to data leakage.
All this happened in just 20 days.
End of quote.
For our listeners who visit our blog,
I will put links to interesting cases, articles,
you will read it in more detail.
Another example from another industry.
Steven Schwartz, a lawyer from the USA,
used the GPT chart during the appeals against Avianca Airlines.
In court, it turned out that the chat gave him fictional facts,
and he quoted them senselessly in court.
Artificial intelligence does not actually base its answers only on facts and data,
but sometimes it invents them itself.
These models work in a way of statistical proofs,
some mathematical models,
but not based on some intelligence,
because there is no intelligence there.
Please always remember this.
Mr. Mariusz, coming back to the question of intelligence,
you said that these systems can learn,
and isn't that just a manifestation of this intelligence,
whatever it is?
And besides, doesn't it lead to the fact that in some time
machines will simply be smarter than people?
I'll put it this way, there is no intelligence there, no wisdom,
because is the calculator smarter than you?
Well, it can count faster and larger numbers,
but it's no wisdom, it's just math.
I think that artificial intelligence eliminates the stupidest people from every profession,
and that's good,
but at the same time it also creates new specialties.
For example, the so-called prompter,
that is, a person writing questions to artificial intelligence,
which is not easy at all,
and most people can't do it, and won't be able to,
just like most people can't use computers so far.
It's not just clicking the mouse, ladies and gentlemen.
In my opinion, it will be the same with these advanced AI systems.
Artificial intelligence tells me that we should take a break.
I invite you to the topic in a moment.

What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What have you heard about?
A few days ago, the whole world followed the march to Moscow,
in the performance of the famous Wagner's group of private troops fighting in Ukraine.
However, few people noticed the information that also appeared in the world media,
that right after the end of this pucz, Russian diplomats flew to several African countries,
where, as it turns out, Wagner's troops are also stationed.
My question is, what is the private military group doing in Africa
and why did Putin send his diplomats there?
Good question.
They are there, above all, to support the dictatorial governments,
the corrupt governments in African countries, at least 10 of which I know.
First of all, they are engaged in the mining of precious minerals,
mainly gold, diamonds, and murdering oppositionists,
murdering political opponents, suppressing riots.
Well, such a normal international activity.
All countries do it, not just Putin.
Does this money go to the Russian state budget or is it consumed in some other way?
I assume that here and there we have no data, no details, for obvious reasons,
of course, because these are illegal funds,
but at the same time these funds go to maintain the whole country,
because we are talking about really huge amounts of money here.
And of course, they also lead to a gigantic wealth,
a tiny group of people who are in power.
In February this year, in Khartoum, Sudan,
the targets, controlling the shipment sent to Moscow,
the shipment that was supposed to contain supposedly cookies,
found gold, and this in a huge amount, about a ton,
according to the Western media.
The case was silenced, since such information has already appeared officially.
Why did the United States or the European Union not influence
the cut of such a source of funding for Moscow?
Why would they influence?
All the greats knew about it for years and used these phenomena in many ways.
And who would actually oppose it?
The bribe-takers from the EU?
The bribe-taker Biden, who has a son of a drug addict and a catcher,
who has been receiving millions of bribes from all over the world for years,
among others from Ukrainian gas and fuel oligarchs?
I don't think there is anyone in power who would have the clear conscience
to act and break such a thieving silence.
Now that it's all out in the open, they'll probably have to do something.
But so far it's been like a mafia, where the bosses can hate each other,
and even kill, but they never stop doing common interests
and stealing from others.
As for these flights, there were more than one, but a dozen,
of which we know for sure, of course.
In addition, a funny fact, the targets got a call from a high-ranking official
that they were to let the plane go and the gold, and that's exactly what happened.
From the available data, I know that we are talking about at least 32 tons
of illegally transported gold only from Sudan.
Because it is estimated that the profits from the gold mine in Central Africa
are a billion dollars a year.
And these examples can be multiplied, because there is a lot of it.
Since it has worked so far, Prigozhin had his share in this interest,
as do I, his group and his soldiers.
So why did he need such an act of rebellion against his superiors in Moscow,
which we all observed a few days ago?
What did he want to gain? Did he actually go to Moscow for justice,
as it was said about his march, which sounds quite absurd.
Knowing history, we know that private military groups rebelled
when they stopped getting paid.
What happened this time? What can we guess?
No, he didn't need it at all, because it was absolutely necessary to him.
It was literally a matter of his survival, in my opinion.
From July 1, his fighters were to join the official army,
which would make him unnecessary there.
And it was when he became the hero of the whole of Russia.
He was welcomed with flowers on the streets, and in my opinion, it worried Putin.
He was also heard about Prigozhin's political ambitions
and really strong support in the so-called military resorts,
which, of course, Putin's government doesn't like, especially in recent years.
From what I learned, Putin allowed Shoigu to quietly pacify
the largest military force that Prigozhin had.
Prigozhin and Shoigu, the Minister of Defense, have hated each other for years,
because Prigozhin didn't share the loot with the entire military mafia.
I think that's the right word.
And they made their lives so miserable that they killed hundreds of his fighters
for their purposeful, incompetent and even almost sabotage decisions.
Of course, there is money involved, because Prigozhin received about a billion dollars,
at least in the last year, which Putin himself admitted at one of the conferences.
We are only talking about legal payments from the budget,
and I assume there was much more of it from illegal money,
as we mentioned, taken, for example, from these mines in Africa,
and also from dozens of legally established businesses,
where one of them is called MIDAS,
which probably says a lot about what he does and what profits he makes.
In my opinion, the explanation for the mystery of this rebellion is the fight of two poles
of Putin's proper power, i.e. the army and special services, mainly the FSB, of course.
Putin has kept them more or less in a balanced opposition,
that's why he could rule for so long.
It seems that he is losing control of them now,
and I assume that one of these forces will win,
probably by killing Putin and killing dangerous opponents,
and subordinating all the less important ones.
Time for a break, we'll be back in a moment.

What's going on Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there?
I wanted to persuade you to talk about war today.
But how about the war as an economic phenomenon?
Let's talk about how much does war cost.
There is now a war on Ukraine beyond our borders,
and last year the Ukrainian prime minister betrayed that one day of war costs his country 70 million dollars.
If we add the foreign aid that Ukraine received,
in 10 months it was stated that it was 150 billion dollars,
on average it gives an additional 300 million dollars.
But it all looks pale and empty when we count the scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
As our media reported, they calculated that Russia costs a billion dollars on the day of the war.
Who can afford such huge expenses?
No one and everyone, literally.
Because it's a pretty interesting phenomenon,
that actually war, from an economic point of view, should be a complete tragedy.
But it is not.
To quote a certain quote,
""During the war, the biggest economic development takes place,
and if we eliminated the boring period of peace, we would actually have development all the time.""
War has a very profound impact on the lives of all societies.
It eliminates a lot of people who really cost.
Who dies in the war most often?
Weak people, the elderly.
So what costs the most is the maintenance of the budget.
There are no protests, no promotions, no one even thinks about it.
So you can keep the whole society very cheaply,
eliminating most of the costs that you normally pay.
The efficiency of work increases,
industrial production increases, which is usually the carrier of development of each country.
So success.
Of course, as you rightly noticed at the beginning,
it all costs an incredible amount of money.
Where do countries that are waging war get the money from?
Ukraine has economic problems.
Because you have to pay for ammunition, for weapons, for equipment.
You have to pay for the soldiers, you have to pay for the damage to those who died,
you have to pay for the costs of treating the wounded.
These are huge expenses.
Where does Ukraine get the money for this, for example?
Yes, you are right.
Looking at this conflict, we see two completely contrary philosophies of financing the war.
Think Tank, a country that deals with energy analysis,
revealed that from the sales of energy carriers,
from the day of the full-scale attack,
almost 100 billion euros flowed into Russia,
of which almost 60% from the EU,
only during the first 100 days of the war.
So, as you said, they have a billion euros a day.
And we pay them for it!
That Russia even makes more money than before the war.
The Special Times recently reported that Moscow could add about 100 billion dollars
to its foreign assets of free extensions.
Russia can also be helped by other activities,
for example, tons of gold or contracts in the style of the construction of a nuclear power plant in Egypt.
Here are some funny facts that the Sudanese air force
searched for a plane to transport cookies to Russia.
They found a box with a ton of gold there.
It was only one of a dozen flights that we know of.
Let's add that for years, through the invasion,
Putin bought hundreds of tons of gold,
which, with a price jump, gave him a huge profit.
Officially, they have about 2,300 tons of gold,
worth about 150 billion dollars.
It will be useful, because the declared expenses for national defense in 2083
are planned to be calculated at $ 84 billion,
which gives about 40% more than they assumed.
Well, what does it look like in the case of Ukraine?
Ukraine does not have such resources.
I will probably surprise listeners by saying who helps Putin in making money.
I quote here a well-informed US intelligence official,
Seymour Hersh.
It was Zelensky who bought diesel oil from the Russians with a discount.
And who paid for petrol and oil? We did.
Putin and his oligarchs earn millions on it.
It is estimated that the president of Ukraine and his entourage
have donated at least $ 400 million to Ukraine
for the purchase of fuel.
Ukraine is currently in the 120th place in the world ranking of corruption in 180 countries.
Therefore, it is shockingly worse than all its neighbors outside Russia.
The issue of corruption was raised during a January visit to Kiev by the CIA chief, William Burns,
who delivered to Zelensky a list of 35 corrupt officials and officers.
Zelensky was forced to react to Washington's attacks.
He publicly fired only 10 people.
He limited himself to officials who brazenly bragged about their money
driving a new Mercedes around Kiev.
This is not the first such corruption sensation of the media hero of Ukraine.
Let me remind you of the Pandora Papers.
What is Ukraine doing now officially?
It is getting longer.
We already know about the military aid that has long exceeded $ 100 billion.
And yet they lose fights.
And they are not able to start the promised offensive.
They make various excuses.
They said it was too hot for the offensive.
Earlier they said it was too cold.
Isabel Coleman from the American International Development Agency
says that Ukraine is facing the biggest reconstruction project in the world.
Ukrainians estimate the costs to be $ 750 billion to $ 1 billion.
And that's a lot of money someone will get.
That's why Zelensky meets Lawrence Fink,
called the king of Wall Street,
the boss of BlackRock.
The same one from the Bud Light scandal from the previous hearing.
Which is being used to pressure on the biggest LGBT,
the Wokeness and similar crazy things.
Mr. Mariusz, let's pause for a moment.
Maybe not a period, but a comma.

[The end]
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
To be honest, I was inspired by our conversation from a week ago
about how unsuccessful TV shows produced in recent or previous years
affect the course of action of large companies producing movies.
I started looking for data on the Internet about the number of viewers
and tickets from the famous series ""The Ring of Power"".
While Amazon, the producer, boasted a lot about the distribution of the series,
how much it invested in its production,
that it cost a record $1 billion in the history of cinema,
it's hard to find enough data on how much it earned.
Is this one of the signs that the movie was a financial flop?
It doesn't necessarily have to be a sign, but it gives a disturbing signal.
If we have something to boast about, why not?
Because we're modest?
No, we know that Amazon Studio and Jeff Bezos are not modest people.
They love to boast about their successes, numbers, achievements.
So it makes you think. You're right.
Especially since in previous series or movies that were cash successes,
it was officially announced that they earned several times more than their production cost.
This one should earn several billion dollars.
Yes, it is.
There were even announcements, sometimes even exaggerated,
because they claimed that 60 years after the release of ""Rings of Power""
it will be a hit and people will watch it.
So I think it will be a mega hit for decades.
And as you mentioned, the look of the predecessor itself is a high barrier.
For example, in 2004 ""Rings of Power"" won 11 Oscars.
So in all categories nominated.
It's impressive.
All three parts won 30 nominations, of which 17.
So let's admit it's a high barrier.
In summary, I'm talking about money.
Money is also impressive.
Let's say that for the 93 million invested in ""Fellowship of the Ring"",
the first part,
this part earned something over 377 million dollars.
And it was the same with every part.
The first trilogy earned about 300-380 million dollars, each part.
Additional parts were released, extended versions, etc.
Each of them also earned millions.
The same with ""The Hobbit"", which was the smallest part,
and also artificially divided from one book into a trilogy.
It also earned an average of 250 million for a part.
These are gigantic amounts.
We are talking about the fact that from a small amount of money,
the company earned a billion dollars from the tickets.
The part where they invested 90 million dollars for the movie.
It's impressive.
So the expectations for ""Rings of Power"" were gigantic.
Mr. Mariusz, we should start with the explanation.
We are guilty of this to our listeners.
The point is to show why the film industry differs from typical industries,
such as steel production, car production.
Why is this business so important?
That's a good question.
It's important because of the amount of money in the media business,
entertainment, as they call it,
which is a widely understood entertainment.
But that's not the key to the puzzle.
It's a socially important business,
because it shapes people's minds and opinions,
which affects all their life decisions.
It shapes the whole country and society.
The powers that be know it perfectly well and use it effectively.
So it's about power and propaganda, not just about money.
He said it in a vulgar way, but it's true.
It's about power and propaganda.
We'll take a break for advertising and music.
We'll be back in a moment.

What's the news Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear?
I read in Business Insider that 8 American billionaires lost almost 400 billion dollars last year.
I wonder how you can lose such money.
They drank it, someone stole it, took it, invested badly, went bankrupt. What happened?
Good question. Indeed, such amounts are falling and I have seen such calculations.
I would also add that it looks more interesting.
For example, the property of Elon Musk has decreased by more than half.
So these are not just billions, which are abstract for all of us,
but we are talking about the fact that one of the richest people in the world lost half of his property.
Literally in a dozen months.
The same goes for Jeff Bezos, as well as many others.
We are talking about the world's largest companies.
We are not talking about investments that went wrong.
We are talking about the fact that their key businesses suddenly fell in value.
How do you estimate the value of such people's assets?
Taking it literally from space.
It is not based on a hard number.
Someone says accounting is a very mathematical thing.
In this case, unfortunately, not at all.
How do you estimate real estate in Manhattan?
How do you calculate it exactly?
How do we know how much it is worth?
Do you calculate the value of bricks?
No.
I can compare it to the values of similar real estate sold before.
Yes, or the needs and possibilities of people who would like to buy.
How much can you sell?
In short, we are talking about demand and sale.
This is a classic case.
How much is a bottle of Coca-Cola worth?
How much does someone who buys want to pay?
Yes, if you offer me this bottle in the desert when I die of thirst,
it will be worth all the money.
You understand.
It is exactly the same with these prices.
Of course, it is not as dramatic as with Coca-Cola,
but sometimes psychology plays the most important role in prices.
There are companies that are trendy,
like Tesla, and suddenly their shares skyrocketed several dozen times.
Stocks that were worth $ 10-15 in 2019,
then began to be worth $ 100, $ 200, $ 300, $ 400.
These are absurd values.
And now the question is what happened
that for a year or two with this company,
the price of Coca-Cola increased from $ 10 to $ 400.
What happened?
It became popular.
But what happened now that it is losing?
They started producing something that did not go into the market?
They made a mistake?
Such money does not go away for no reason.
You are right, they do not go away for no reason.
There are many reasons.
I will give one.
China.
Tesla invested huge amounts of money in mega factories in China.
And then it would seem that it is a brilliant move.
Today, when there were first lockdowns, strikes,
and now China's closure of the US economy,
the so-called trade war between China and the US,
at this point, this Tesla factory in China is rather a burden, a problem,
than a profit.
Investors are not idiots.
Not all, but most investors are not idiots.
So they noticed it all.
For example, one detail.
The second is the lack of battery availability.
Tension on the Taiwan-China line.
Because it may suddenly turn out that we will not have chips,
we will not have batteries for all these devices.
The same with Apple.
A big strike of the factory in China.
Exactly the Apple factory in China.
And at this point, what is a company worth that cannot produce anything?
Literally.
Because there is nowhere.
And what control does it have over it?
The answer is exactly none.
Because it is decided only by the Chinese government,
and what happened in China.
They have no influence on it.
That's what it's about.
This is one of the aspects.
The second aspect is that what I have also repeatedly signaled for years,
in the opinion of the media, that there is a huge crisis.
Finally, what I have been saying since 2018, very loudly,
now reaches the public space.
And people say, ""Damn, there is a huge crisis.""
So all the indicators of all industries are falling.
All tech industries are going down.
Of course, they are not going down so horribly,
as we say here, I don't know, about half and so on.
No, no, no.
But it still shows that these are symptoms of a threat,
such black clouds that are gathering.
Investors don't like it either.
Because the future doesn't look bright for them.
So this is the second aspect.
Because in 2022 miracles happened.
Stocks went up?
Damn.
Uda.

What's up Mr. Mariusz?
What do you want to hear?
I wanted to talk to you about earnings, and this is a difficult topic, although it concerns absolutely everyone.
And we all generally complain about our earnings, and meanwhile, as I read on the Internet, in Bangladesh, the minimum wage,
and this is after the increase, which will come in December, will be 114 dollars per month,
that's 456 zlotys.
For comparison, the minimum wage in Bangladesh is currently 75 dollars, which is about 300 zlotys.
In Poland, the minimum wage is 3600 zlotys.
In January, it will increase to over 4000 zlotys.
So in Poland, it is about 10 times more than in Bangladesh.
Can we compare the minimum wage level in different countries like Poland and Bangladesh?
Can we conclude that we have an excellent wage?
The wage is only a number.
The purchasing power of a given currency is counted, and also the standard of living provided by it.
You can be a rich man in one part of the world, and at the same time an average man somewhere else.
Let's look at Poland, where, as far as I remember, a German or a Frenchman had a few hundred percent of his average pension.
For many years, the idiocy of the EU has shown that even the richest countries in Europe are systematically getting poorer,
but they still have an advantage over us.
I have always been told, Mr. Mariusz, that the pension depends on the efficiency.
The efficiency in such a slum in Bangladesh is probably a lot.
Yes, they have amazing efficiencies there.
You probably wear a shirt or pants sewn there.
Let me check for fun, such experiments were done.
It always ends up in some kind of half-slave or even completely slave labor, including very often the work of children, ladies and gentlemen.
So maybe you should start looking at the marks.
It is you who really enslave these people through your decisions.
A company that has a well-known brand will do a promotion, because they literally buy it for money.
For them, such a workshop is money.
That's why these products and materials are money.
Do you know what they cost the most?
Packing and transport.
Most people have no idea, or of course, who is supposed to tell them that.
What do they tell them at school?
The media? Well, the media say what they are paid for.
Unless there really is no way out, there is a big scandal.
We were talking about, for example, the million-dollar labor camps in China,
which you probably have some things at home that the slaves physically and really did.
Anyway, the ethnic minority, which is totally enslaved and exterminated on a scale that you would think Hitler.
This is a pentacle in the current China, with which everyone trades.
Mr. Mariusz, let's get back to the issue of wages.
I have a question of a fundamental nature, which I often ask.
Should the state authorities intervene between the employee and his employer and set a minimum wage level?
Or should it be left to some market game, the negotiation skills of an employee who can bargain a little more?
The only system that interferes with the economy is the communist ideology.
And as far as I know, it never ended well.
We currently have a massive attack of communist ideologies in the Western world.
The effects are visible to the naked eye.
If we don't stop it, it will end as always.
An economic collapse and most often mass and million-dollar deaths.
Because that's exactly what history teaches us.
The example from Bangladesh goes on.
The negotiations of wages and the establishment of a new minimum wage level took place after a series of demonstrations.
And it's such a hard start with the police.
A dozen people were injured, two people died in the clashes with the police.
Can you imagine that we will be with our employer to set our wages, running away to strikes, demonstrations and beatings?
I think that these are inevitable. It's just a matter of time.
The shoe from the bath is still wet until the ear is torn off.
The media does not show what is happening.
But such things, demonstrations, fights with the police, are happening in practically every country in the West.
The famous protest in Canada.
We are talking about at least hundreds of thousands of people here.
Some people were talking about million-dollar sins.
People who openly told the government ""No, we've had enough of it"".
Canada was synonymous with wealth, luxury.
Yes, and peace.
Yes, of course.
Let's take the Netherlands now.
What's going on there?
What are the farmers' fights with the government?
It's not talked about in a common way.
It's everywhere.
People are extremely dissatisfied.
The media, of course, masks it to the maximum.
But at some point, as with the Zban, people get fed up.
In my opinion, in Poland, we are still holding on somehow.
The Poles are extremely persistent, extremely helpful and extremely understanding.
But even the Poles can say ""enough"" and even put themselves in the greatest military force in the world,
that is, the Warsaw Pact.
Mr. Mariusz, but there are some civilized methods.
There are three-way commissions with the participation of entrepreneurs, trade unions and representatives of authorities,
where such things are simply negotiated and established in a civilized way.
Can you give me an example of such success anywhere in the world?
Because I don't know.
Well, in Poland it was established that the minimum wage will be 4242 PLN from next year.
And it's in such a commission.
And you think it's a success, I understand, right?
Well, from the point of view of an employee, it will increase by 500 PLN, so it's probably some kind of success.
First of all, employees do not establish this in any way,
only intermediaries who live to make it bad.
Both sides live from the work of these employees.
They literally work for them.
What conditions will the dog's life set in order?
Such that it eats the best.
That's the whole problem, that there is no such thing here that the workers really stand in their place.
I will give an example, maybe from abroad, such a very big one.
Jimmy Hoffa, who was the most important trade union activist in the United States.
Practically, he had more strength than the president of the United States, sir.
I once watched a movie about his uninteresting arrangements.
Let's use our initiative again, which we have created together, audycje.com.pl.
I can just throw some material on this topic, so that you realize
what the arrangement between the government and trade unions or trade unions looks like in reality.
Because there it was exposed in an amazing, unquestionable way.
Choosing another president of trade unions will not change anything.
Because the system does not change, the system does not change.
Because both sides that negotiate on behalf of the workers live from the workers.
The mafia ruled the trade unions in the United States.
This is how the world works, ladies and gentlemen.
If someone is making fun of you that we have it differently, then make fun of it further.
All people have the same advantages, the same disadvantages.
Will we let these bad disadvantages flourish?
Or maybe we will try to eliminate, as far as possible, these pathological systems?
We will continue the topic after the break.

Mr. Mariusz, what's going on?
What did you hear there?
I remembered our conversation about the American civil protest against the Bad Light beer.
And I wonder if such a civil protest could happen in Poland,
because we are dealing with a law that is coming into effect,
which is causing a lot of controversy.
And I think we're just at the beginning of this road.
Specifically, it's about the renewal of mining law,
especially the regulations on so-called strategic deposits.
And according to these regulations, if the main geologist of the country decides
that something in the ground, some minerals or other deposits,
are strategic for the country,
then the owner of this land will not be able to put anything on it.
And a fundamental question, Mr. Mariusz,
do we have to protect our natural resources deposits so much?
It's not that you can't build on your own land.
The point is that there may even be instruments for taking this land from us
and passing it on to anyone.
Answering the question, I think that whatever you call it,
""protection of deposits"", it doesn't make any sense to me.
These are currently operating mechanisms
of practically perfect protection of all Polish deposits
through three levels.
Concessions and licenses necessary for mining,
transportation, sales, processing of deposits.
Two. The level of costs, technology and knowledge that must be possessed
to be able to mine anything on any scalable scale.
And safety and environmental regulations
that prevent mining of any deposits
in places that are not properly prepared for it.
What if someone has a deposit of something under the house?
Nickel, gold?
What would happen if one of the Poles had his own oil shale?
Mr. Mariusz, I see it differently.
It seems to me that the intention of the authorities is that
some proverbial Polish, Kowalski,
who has a piece of land above the deposit of a valuable resource,
did not block the construction of a mine,
because, for example, he will not agree to sell this land.
But why would he sell it, if it's his land
and according to any logic it should be his deposit?
But if he has a plot of land that has a hectare,
and the deposit takes hundreds of hectares,
and it is not worth it to create a large enterprise
and buy it in the neighborhood,
it is more likely that someone will buy it,
and he does not agree and blocks a large investment.
That's exactly what it's about.
So let's say you have a hectare of land,
you sow beets on it,
at this point someone comes and says,
""Listen, I'll give you a million zlotys.
Let's apply logic, let's apply facts,
let's apply examples from life.
If someone has a huge wealth to choose from,
will he choose a heavy plow on a piece of land?
Well, let's be honest,
a hectare of land will not give you any great maintenance.
These are the laws of the economy, sir,
that those should have resources
who have the best methods of using them.
And here we have the rule of communism.
The party always knows better what is good for the citizens,
and this stupid citizen,
let him be stupid and poor,
will be deported.
And this is how his millionaire career ends.
What is better for Poles is probably obvious.
What is better for Poland?
Well, this matter
may be an example of a certain diversity of interests
between an individual person and the interest of the nation.
But I wanted to ask you earlier about something else, Mr. Mariusz.
Deportation regulations have existed for a long time
and have been applied.
There are even special laws
enabling the extraction of land for the construction of roads,
for the construction of gas pipelines.
Why does this law arouse such great controversy?
And it really does,
because a social protest against this law is born on the Internet.
Let's add not only on the Internet.
From what I know,
at all stages of social consultations
there was a negative,
a clearly negative opinion of all the committees.
And yet, however, we see the procedure of this law,
which is a very bad signal for me.
Because if we live in the so-called democracy,
the government of the people,
then if the people say clearly,
""No, it's a stupid idea,
no, we don't want this,
we don't like it at all,
and the authorities are still proceeding,""
then let's argue with the idea of ​​democracy.
What you have said so far,
the extraction laws are in force,
but this is a very important difference,
which has never been before.
The construction of a gas pipeline or roads
is a very special matter,
rarely used,
because how many gas pipelines will you build?
These are not big, dense networks.
Moreover, it is easy to predict,
these are long-term processes.
These are not things that would concern
most Poles, let's be honest.
Here we are talking about a scandalously small fracture.
But if we talk about deposits,
Poland has some deposits in two-thirds.
Everywhere.
In short, we are talking about the entire Polish area.
We are not talking about some minimal,
symbolic, not even percentage.
Here we are talking about something that may potentially concern
a crushing part of our country.
It can happen to me,
my family,
in my city,
to my children.
This is a completely different scale of phenomena,
really on a completely different level.
Let's put a stop here,
but we'll come back to our discussion in a moment.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
Quite recently you complained about Ukrainian citizens,
who quickly get a right to retire in Poland.
Meanwhile, I recently saw an interview with the president of ZUS.
She revealed that it was thanks to a million foreigners,
of which probably 750,000 are Ukrainians,
foreigners who pay us for pensions and health insurance.
The situation of the Social Security Fund is stable.
So in practice, no one from the pensions has to worry
that they won't get a pension for a while and that there will be some problems with the payment of pensions.
So maybe the benefits of hiring Ukrainians are greater than losses.
Anyway, I don't even know how many pensions we pay for Ukrainians
and what the amounts are, because I haven't found such data anywhere.
You probably won't find them easily.
No one would have a hand if you could find them so easily.
Let's say you have financial problems and can't afford to pay.
What now? What now?
I'll take a momentary credit and suddenly everything goes as it should.
It's cool, because nothing works, right?
Well, not really, I guess.
Well, because then you have to pay that moment.
Bravo.
That's the problem, that it's not just one problem.
Number one.
Just let them search on TikTok, YouTube and they'll see Ukrainians
who teach other Ukrainians how to pay pensions from Poland.
And we're not saying that they're persuading, ""Oh, work until you're 60.""
No, no, no, no, no one says that and they don't plan it at all.
Of course, if you check the average Polish pension, it's not high.
But in Ukraine, such a pension is PLN 250-70.
So no matter how much they get in the Polish pension system,
for them it's just an amazing luxury
that they'll have to pay for the rest of their lives.
I quickly checked the economic status of Ukrainians in Poland.
The Economic Cooperation and Development Organization
calculated in its report that Poland has spent the most money
from all countries on covering the costs of supporting Ukrainians,
the so-called ""pensioners.""
Let's be honest, we pay the same amount as all the countries together.
For 10 months of 2022, we spent PLN 40 billion.
I think that Ukrainians in taxes or ZUS, etc.
paid any noticeable amount, similar to this.
I'm going to restore you.
Not at all, it's completely noticeable.
Their impact on our economy.
But the impact is very measurable, very noticeable.
So even this destroys any sense
that Ukrainians are staying in Poland at all,
in any amount, to be honest.
I read in this report that, I quote,
""Ukrainian citizens staying in Poland
send an average of PLN 771 a month to their country.""
Per person, right?
Yes.
This is evidenced by studies conducted by the Migration Platform
and the University of Warsaw's study.
More than half of Ukrainians declare that they send money to Poland,
and only 6% receive it.
So we, sir, we finance 94% of their lives,
not only their lives,
but we also finance their families, their businesses,
their money in Ukraine.
When I saw the questionnaire of studies
conducted by the Migration Platform,
Ukrainian citizens receive an average of PLN 961 a month
after all the expenses related to Poland.
The Border Guard, since February 2022,
has recorded 15.5 million entries to Poland from Ukraine.
15.5 million entries!
Officially, I took from the government data,
that 328,000 Ukrainian children use the 500+.
You can guess that the number of mothers
must be significantly less than the number of children.
Let's round it up, let it be a crazy half a million mothers with children.
15.5 million entered, and half a million only mothers with children.
So who entered us?
You said that maybe it is beneficial for us,
and why for ZUS?
Well, let's take a look at ZUS.
ZUS is bankrupt.
We have to pay about PLN 300 billion in the next years from the budget
to pay for the certificates.
So ZUS is not able to finance itself from what it receives.
And we are talking about a gigantic disparity in what it needs and what affects it.
Do you remember the moment when there was such a big hole,
that they took every Ukrainian, so that they worked for a while,
there will be some payment, and they will make payments from it.
But despite this, we still have to pay from the budget.
ZUS is bankrupt, it is evident.
Is ZUS bankrupt?
Obviously not.
Because according to the Constitution,
not ZUS, but the Polish government is responsible for the payments.
The whole Poland would have to officially announce bankruptcy,
so that ZUS could go bankrupt.
That's why you can steal ZUS as much as you want,
because it will always be added as much as it is necessary for this system to work.
Of course, from the pockets of taxpayers, i.e. ours.
I will give you a word,
but if we have a wave of emigrants who work now,
and there are several hundred thousand people,
some of them may stay permanently in Poland.
They will not support this pension system in any significant way,
staying here?
If our pension system is inefficient in the current system,
when a Pole works until the age of 60,
then if we add people to it,
who will not work as much,
so they will invest much less.
Money circulates in the economy like blood,
and nourishes individual organs,
individual industries, individual companies.
And suddenly, someone will let go of this blood,
and this blood flows elsewhere, abroad.
The same is with markets,
with Western companies that do not pay taxes here,
and take profits for themselves.
They just cut our veins,
and pump out Polish blood,
Polish money, you see?
Ukrainians do exactly the same.
We are talking about millions of people who do this.
ZUS itself is an inefficient organ at many levels.
I will give you a quote from portalumany.pl.
""The Supreme Court has revoked two years of prison,
penalties for Sylwester R.
former president of the Social Welfare Institute
and Tadeusz R.
former director of the ZUS branch of the Szczecin University.
Next title.
Millions of zlotys spent on levy of sick leave.
And so on and so forth.
Our money is not in good hands, sir.
The system is inefficient on its own,
and people who work in the system
brutally use it,
and they are deteriorating the whole system.
And Ukrainians are doing even worse things.
A very large example,
which the media does not write at all,
which shocks me.
Stealing the Polish VAT system by Ukrainians.
Portal cbagov.pl
A citizen of Ukraine was to withdraw
VAT tax on the border.
The detention has to do with the withdrawal of VAT
returned on the borders as a tax-free
and a capture for the guards.
The documents were for a total amount of PLN 200,000.
The charges were heard by 40 people,
and the services are planning further arrests.
To sum up,
we are talking about a great Ukrainian mafia
massively extorting VAT taxes.
In short, money from our budget,
from the state's pocket.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
In the Republic of Poland, for example.
I quote.
""Companies cooperating with entities
supporting the victims of war
do not pay and will not pay VAT
for donated goods and services.
The condition for using a zero rate
is the content of a written contract
of an entrepreneur with one of the above-mentioned entities.
It should result from it that donated goods
or services are associated with the help of the injured.
What is interesting,
there is no control system
in the Ukraine,
what is happening with these goods.
How are we supposed to control them
in a foreign country,
especially so corrupted,
and during the war?
So let's guess
what is happening with Polish money.
Because we physically spend,
we pay them VAT returns.
I myself saw in my own eyes
Ukrainians who buy products in Poland,
on the border they declare that they are exporting them,
they get a return money,
and in Poland they sell them
for example on OLIX, Allegro and so on.
I'm not saying that all Ukrainians
are stealing VAT from us,
because not everyone is probably so crazy,
but we say that each of them can do it.
Because there is no control over it,
no one controls it,
because who would?
Let you try to do something like that.
You won't do it, why?
Because you don't deserve it.
That's the whole joke.
There is nothing I could imagine
economically,
that could compensate us
for the gigantic losses we are incurring,
for which you and your children
will pay.
There is no other option.
To be even better,
we are good, we help
the poor, oppressed, the attacked.
But unfortunately, it's not like that.
I took data from the US Congress,
where serious debates are taking place,
because the Americans have already realized
that Ukrainians are not able to calculate
hundreds of billions of dollars
that were sent there.
And they are able to calculate it
in an absurdly scandalous way.
And the US secret services
started to reveal
corruption scandals
in the nearest environment of Zelenski.
Because they didn't react to the notes
that were sent to them,
that they should do something with the theft,
with the catchers, with the crooks,
because it's on too large a scale.
The aid that goes, the goods,
which I also say, zero watts,
which come from Poland,
you have no control over what will happen.
And we know for sure that it lands
on the black market,
in the hands of the mafiosos
who trade it.
In short.
Mr. Mariusz, time for a break.
After the break, we'll come back
to the topic of the pension system.
