[music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What did you hear again?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I checked a few forecasts from the year before, which were set for 2022, and few of them turned out to be prophetic.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, for example, the inflation forecast. Even the president of the National Bank of Poland was wrong.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's quite typical. Why else?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Because he's an expert.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, some say that, but I say that there is a lot of pressure on most of the experts I know from most of the areas I have contact with.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Even financial influence cases are documented on the position, opinion or decision of experts.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I don't think it should be a shock to anyone.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Before we get to the topic, it's time to introduce our guest, and he is and will be our weekly guest, Mariusz Stefaniak.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A man who connects many fields, both as a practitioner and as a theorist.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Economist, financialist, manager, among other large IT companies, marketing specialist, and most of all, the president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's pay attention to the name - "Więcej Mądrości".

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Every week we will meet regularly and talk about the economy and the complexity of the world.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good morning, Mr. Mariusz.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello, I bow.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's get back to the topic.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
An example of a wrong forecast is the housing market.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was supposed to develop infinitely, prices were supposed to rise, demand was supposed to rise, and here it suddenly turns out that not so much.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, this is a beautiful example.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why were these forecasts so optimistic in this case?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Optimistic? There is only one answer, because this is what you earn.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And you earn huge money.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please note that the real estate market is one of the most profitable markets in the world.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Developers earn, landowners earn, good business.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Governments earn, sir.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is probably the most important.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A great example, for example, such an extreme, but the largest in the world, are China.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
One day we can talk about it in detail, I will show the whole mechanism, a shocking mechanism, I assume for the majority.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
For me, a completely standard thing in this industry.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I am saving topic number one for the next edition.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But we also have the cryptocurrency market, which has grown incredibly and it seemed that it would also grow all the time.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, the forecasts were amazing.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I remember forecasts that said that in 2022 Bitcoin would cost 120, 140, 150 thousand dollars.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, how much it costs today, it's easy to see.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The mechanism itself, ladies and gentlemen, and it's easy to notice a certain scheme, because you make great money on it.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
On recording something that we can safely call speculative banks.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But someone goes, someone else buys, agrees, accepts these prices.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So what, we have on the one hand, the players, and on the other hand, the sheep that go where they are told?

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Exactly, you know it well.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is how you can emphasize all events in the history of the world.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sheep go to slaughter, and the shepherd benefits from it.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But let's get back to the topic of experts who predict and not always or rarely do they come across these predictions.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do we have bad experts or do we have experts who work on someone else's order, not necessarily those who listen to them?

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We definitely have good experts in the world and they are brilliant people, great specialists.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But a completely strange coincidence is not the people who are most liked and promoted by the government, the media or large corporations.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They can't get through with their message to the mass media, to public information.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, because this message warns the sheep that they are going to slaughter.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, the shepherd can't like such a message, please forgive me, no shepherd will agree to someone who will warn the sheep before entering the slaughterhouse.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, because they will rebel.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, or they will go the other way, because it will suddenly turn out that the shepherd cannot handle hundreds of thousands of sheep at once.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Unless the sheep will follow the sheep that leads them.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, Mr. Marysia, but maybe we live in very unpredictable times, maybe it was simply not possible to predict the war and the attack of Russia on Ukraine.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, the facts speak differently, sir.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The facts that have been documented beyond any doubt are that at least 7 months earlier, the largest governments had 100% certain data on the attack.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What will it be, how will it be, where will it be? These are the facts. It was even half-published.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It didn't get to the public opinion.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It did, you just have to know where to read it.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
At this point, we will take a short break, we will be back after a moment of music.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Music.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000

88

Music.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Music.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's up, Mr. Mariusz? We're back on the air. Our guest is an economist, a financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Mariusz, one of the examples of events, actually global events, which dominated the world public opinion for a very long time and suddenly stopped, is the COVID pandemic.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Two years ago, it was number one on all news, everyone was afraid of the pandemic. Suddenly, we stopped being afraid of it.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is COVID still a real threat? Was it a real threat to us?

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was, without a doubt, but not as people believed.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What do you mean?

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, COVID was and is a deadly threat, but economically, financially, socially, that's its main, crushing, deadly force.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But the virus attacks humans, not the economy.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're right, but from what I know, we absorb a huge amount of viruses every day and somehow we live. And you've known that for thousands, thousands, thousands of years.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And if you checked the scientific facts, what I did at the beginning of the pandemic, because I didn't know either, of course, I'm not an omnibus, so I learned.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And what I saw solved most of the questions for the next two years.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But I can also show you exactly what I did, how I did it and how I ended up.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because it's slowly coming out and it's coming out on a gigantic scale. And it will be coming out for at least another year, that's for sure.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So let him tell you a little more.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
For example, I will give you simple facts that are published again, so I will be able to verify what I say very quickly.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For example, in a mysterious way, contracts with the largest companies that have received vaccines around the world have disappeared.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And officials from the European Union are not able to present contracts on the basis of which they bought and introduced vaccines to the circulation.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They even forced people to take it, at least they persuaded, and at times they forced.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And now they are not able to show these documents on the basis of which they did it.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And in other countries similar things are happening.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And please believe me that this is only going to get deeper.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In addition, there were also evident financial links between the most important officials who were responsible for implementing these regulations,

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
again with the same companies that were making money on it.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And these are documented things.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Another fact that has already been published is that some governors in the United States have already officially submitted a report on the pursuit,

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the explanation of the pursuit of the COVID-19 curfew,

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that is, the introduction of dangerous substances into circulation,

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
which could and are fully aware that they were introduced,

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
with full awareness that they could cause damage, even deaths,

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and it was associated with corruption.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So these are things that, in my opinion, will dominate at the beginning of 2023,

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
because people will be outraged by this lethargy,

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that governments were taking care of their safety by introducing radical regulations that are in contradiction,

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
such as, for example, in Poland with the Constitution,

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
with the regulations of the higher order,

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
with the limitation of freedom,

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the right to move,

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the right to conduct economic activity.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
After all, you certainly know that almost all prohibitions, prohibitions and penalties were later annulled by the courts,

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
because they were inconsistent with the law.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
As a contradiction with the Constitution.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So what, we're going back to the sheep herd scheme again,

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
which are mindlessly following the voice of the shepherd,

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and the shepherd is not merciful to them?

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes, and some kill. Exactly.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is not the only thing that will probably dominate in 2023.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There are other international problems that are less heard about in Poland,

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
we talk less about it,

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
but things are happening in the world arena that may have a very strong impact on us soon.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
For example, the situation in China.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What happened there?

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, we have to pay special attention to China in 2023,

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
because in my opinion it will have an impact on the whole world.

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
On many levels.

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Of course, as an economist, I will pay the most attention to these economic aspects,

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but as a human being I will also look very carefully at political ones,

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
including those related to the outbreak of even some conflict.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are talking about a military conflict.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's face it.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I would not like to use the words "World War III",

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but such thoughts may come to mind.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
At this point, we will take a short break,

153
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we will be back after a moment of music.

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Music

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Music

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Music

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Our guest is an economist, financier, expert Mariusz Stefaniak.

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We felt that the war is quite possible after the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
For us, it appeared, for example, with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So we see that it can have an impact on each of us.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, here I would like to debunk a myth.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And it's such a terrifying myth and widely believed to be true.

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Number one. Currently, there are the most wars in the history of the world.

164
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So it has never been as bad in the world as in recent years.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And contrary to what people think,

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it was the time when pro-peaceful international organs were formed.

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This should make you think.

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Secondly, the gigantic concentration of power in one hand or in a small amount of hands

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
is usually a reason for anxiety or at least for very careful observation of this person who decides.

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The truth is that people who currently hold power are not controlled by anyone.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Not only that, most of them are not even elected by people.

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
A classic example is the EU authorities.

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Did you elect them?

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Do you know who elected them, who decides who rules Europe?

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, it's a very complicated system of indirect elections.

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Representatives elect other representatives and so on and so forth.

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
At some point, you lose complete control over it.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, again, one of my important parts of my professional life is being an expert when it comes to European finance, European funds.

179
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
For many years, I have been teaching at graduate schools, I am the author of a book,

180
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
one of the first in Poland, written jointly with people from the Ministry,

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
on the subject of funds, the implementation of European funds.

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So I also assume that I can speak quite sensibly in this area.

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Believe me, the number of things, the number of absurdities,

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
which a normal person is not even able to believe, and which are of course a fact,

185
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I also learned it directly from the European Parliamentarians,

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
because I was there, of course, I talked, I was there.

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And believe me, it looks completely different than you could ever guess,

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
judging by leaks or some media information.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Most authorities look different if you are close to these authorities.

190
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So please believe me, people don't know a lot of things.

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A lot of things that fundamentally change the whole world view.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, I say, I am so lucky that my professional life is very closely related to business, finance,

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and often, unfortunately, also with politics.

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I say unfortunately, because what I have learned, what I have learned, has very, very, very changed my approach to it.

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I generally laugh that I have no political views.

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because I met people so highly positioned, so close, most of whom I know from TV,

197
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that I look at political views completely differently.

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
At least political decisions.

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And again, economic knowledge goes into the abyss.

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The old Latin saying, "If you want to reach the truth, follow the path of money."

201
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And this is a good advice, in my opinion, for every listener.

202
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
A short poem to sum up today's audition.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The old year is over.

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Time to sum up.

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Where are the gains and increases?

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Bitcoins?

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Apartments?

208
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Losses?

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
War, crisis, fuel prices are rising.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I have enough promises.

211
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think I'm getting smarter.

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This will also be the goal of our audition.

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
To talk about things that people don't quite understand, and often these are completely hidden matters.

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Mr. Mariusz, thank you for the first time.

215
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I hope we managed to interest and encourage the listeners.

216
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We will be on the air again in a week.

217
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is "Grany", Mr. Mariusz.

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Until next time.

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Once again, our guest was an economist, financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.

220
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Thank you very much.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The audition was conducted by Krzysztof Strauchman.

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Inne Radio in Głuchołazy and the area 105,2.
