1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
There are not many games in Poland surrounded by such a cult as the good old Gothic,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,260
whose first installment ended as early as 23 years ago this year.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,360
On the scale of the phenomenon of this series, it may be that an official remake of the first installment is being created,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,600
over two years ago there was the premiere of the great, huge mod to the second Gothic - Chronicles of Myrtana Archolos,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,960
or that quite recently the first two Gothic games have reached their ports on Switch.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,560
Although far from perfect, but still.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,800
In addition, the community of fans is constantly creating smaller mods to these games,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,480
including the development of Gothic Online, which you may have seen several times on my channel.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,800
As some of you probably know, from time to time I tend to look closer at larger or more ambitious projects,

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,440
mainly related to the Witcher or Gothic universe,

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,480
and this time I came across this second game and a very ambitious project called Veritas RP,

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,800
which I will try to tell you about today.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Enjoy the video!

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,160
[Veritas RP]

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,120
A team of over 20 enthusiasts decided to create a role-playing server,

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,400
thanks to which each of us will be able to live in the new,

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,640
set in the Gothic universe, fan-made princedom, entitled Veritas.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
I recently had the opportunity to talk to three people from the team responsible for this project.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,240
Pawel Jaroslaw Olszak, the main programmer,

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,800
Konrad Jaged Zawiszek, the leader of the 3D department,

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,200
and Daniel Hoffman-Kamiński, the owner and creator of the server.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,800
And the fragments of the conversation with them will be intertwined during the episode.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,080
♫ Although my heart longs for you, ♫

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,280
♫ a year is waiting for you. ♫

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,360
♫ Veritas is safe ♫

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,040
♫ when you take a quiet step. ♫

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,160
Where did the idea for creating this server come from and why Gothic?

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,200
You know what, it's a pretty interesting story,

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,080
because almost three years ago,

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,960
my friend and I wanted to play roleplay,

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,520
because we've been playing roleplay since 2007,

32
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,440
but in a timely, earlier release.

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,200
We had three different approaches,

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,000
because at first we assumed that we wanted to create something of our own,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,360
so we thought about Bannerlord,

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,280
but we did it because of the small Polish community,

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,680
quite a large threshold due to the hardware requirements and the price of the game itself,

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,200
so we abandoned it.

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,360
The second thing was a project that fell apart very quickly,

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,680
and it was a multiplayer platform for The Witcher 3, which fell apart.

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,440
And Gothic remained.

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,080
At that time, there was a project, we played it for a while,

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,480
we realized that it was something completely different than what we are used to.

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,120
And that's how my idea to make Veritas came about.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,520
The number of people is hard to estimate,

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,040
as I said, over the two years,

47
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,400
the rotation was what it was, a lot of people came, a lot of people left.

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,360
At this point, I didn't count, there are probably over 20 people.

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,520
At this point, we have 27 people.

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,120
Exactly, at this point 27 people, and there are different people.

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,680
The project is divided into many sectors that work relatively autonomously,

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,840
we have a game design, which is responsible for designing all the game solutions

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,160
in terms of how a given system is supposed to work,

54
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,280
and ultimately there are game masters and supporters,

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,080
so there are people who design the world presented together with me,

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,480
or will ultimately serve the player in the first line.

57
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,400
We have a script department with a representative, with Jarek,

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,600
who is with us at the conversation, who is implementing this design,

59
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,800
he has already signed up for the code.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,080
We have a 3D department, which is represented by Jaged, who is also present with us.

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,600
Here we have a 2D department, we have a music department, and we have a department responsible for the web,

62
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,800
which is responsible for all the issues of the forum, the blending page,

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,080
or web applications, in which both the administration and the players

64
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,000
will be able to manage most of the aspects related to the game.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,560
For the sake of the project, the team will create an author's map,

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,120
which will be mostly surrounded by the city itself, playing the role of the capital of the principality.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,000
Anyway, the Veritas map should be displayed on your screen.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,880
According to the description of the plot, the Veritas principality is an autonomous feudal entity,

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,840
which was created in its time as a result of the Veritas Union.

70
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,000
A few years before the union, the Veritas city law was passed by the king of the Robar I, who was then the lord of Myrtana.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,360
Veritas has a long and rich history.

72
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,120
The principality includes vast areas in the south of the Kingdom of Myrtana,

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,440
including three slaves, three cities and 25 villages.

74
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,160
Taking into account that our country and our entire universe is something completely new,

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,280
not related to any mod, no canon, so it's a completely new creation,

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,080
we also had to think about how we want to introduce it into the Gothic universe.

77
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,040
And while such final dates are not yet finalized,

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,520
due to the fact that Gothic itself is quite empty and not quite easy to work with when it comes to dating,

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,760
I can say that when it comes to the plot itself, which will take place during the project,

80
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,240
when the players will start playing it,

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,960
we assumed that we would consider the entire Gothic 1 canon,

82
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,480
the entire Gothic 2, but Gothic 2 ends in our timeline,

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,520
that the hero defeated the beast, sailed to the sea and the hearing about him disappeared.

84
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,000
So everything related to Gothic 2 is canon,

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,040
Gothic 3 is no longer related to the start of the project, it is dated to about 15-20 years after the events of Gothic 2.

86
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,600
The war is still going on, although the front does not move towards the Kingdom of Myrtana as it takes place in Gothic 3.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,560
However, when it comes to the history of Veritas and its creation,

88
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,600
or the existence for a few hundred years,

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,360
they will be intertwined with the main timeline of Myrtana's life.

90
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,680
When it comes to the general outline that introduces the total layman from the outside,

91
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,320
it introduces him more or less in what we are dealing with here,

92
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,800
the story that we will build within the boundaries of our principality,

93
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,640
precisely within the boundaries of its capital, because the game will take place there,

94
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,440
it is really only and exclusively dependent on where the players will go, what ideas they will have,

95
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
and what trend we will eventually take.

96
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,320
In addition to its own map or unique plot,

97
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,560
the team responsible for Veritas will also create original armor,

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,200
weapons for both close and long-range combat,

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,960
a new professional soundtrack or various interesting innovations.

100
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,440
My attention was drawn to the fact that players will be able to buy a flat in the city,

101
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,400
which they will be able to equip according to their own preferences,

102
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,280
but in order not to significantly limit the number of such apartments,

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,640
it will work on the principle that after entering their home, the player will move to a separate room,

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,800
which in reality will be located somewhere deep underground.

105
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,480
At the beginning, we will be able to create our character with the help of the editor,

106
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,280
and we will be able to join almost anyone we want.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,480
Veritas, as it turned out in the capital of the principality, i.e. a large city,

108
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,880
is to have a lot to offer.

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,960
There will be many districts in it -

110
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,640
Central, Portowa, to which Slams and Port Koronny will also belong,

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,160
then the residential district, Klasztorna, Rzemieślnicza, Burżuazyjna and Górne Miasto.

112
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,080
And looking at the map, today we can find an amphitheater,

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,680
a basement of the Crown Guard, a university, a town hall and a dresser,

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,200
a shipyard, a citadel, a crown port, a Torino Palace or even a palace of the Duchess.

115
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,000
You know what, when it comes to signed buildings,

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,680
we wanted to designate such icons that have some permanent functions,

117
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,160
so as not to, to put it bluntly, to put a label on the whole map.

118
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,480
However, most buildings are either generic, I will explain what it is about in a moment,

119
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
or have some function.

120
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:58,920
We are talking about buildings that will either be intended for the user as a place to live for a given character,

121
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,120
so it will be a building to be bought by the player and managed under him,

122
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,680
or a building as an object intended for the group will be purchased.

123
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,440
So either for a workshop or some project, someone can play an association and want to play something there,

124
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,160
so you can buy a hall and play it there.

125
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,360
In general, we have over 200 unique buildings, so there is a lot of it.

126
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,720
The choice of what we will be able to do will be large.

127
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,360
What should be emphasized, the map will be devoid of NPCs,

128
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,280
so all the roles in the city will have to be occupied by players.

129
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,000
Players who, despite the great freedom in the world of Veritas,

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,560
will have to follow certain rules.

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,760
First of all, the regulations of the economy in the city,

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,560
or the players will have to stick to the scenario and try not to leave their roles.

133
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,960
But how does such a PRP work?

134
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
After all, some may not know it.

135
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,000
The roleplay is not equal and I think that the Gothic 2 Online platform itself shows it well.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,640
I think that the project owner has a different vision, more or less different from the original.

137
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,080
However, we are creating a project based on classic platform roleplay,

138
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,360
such as players of older age who played on Samp or MTA,

139
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,640
from such top servers as The Gaming or LSRP, will associate.

140
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,320
So, to put it simply, for people from the outside, roleplay in our edition

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,080
is nothing more than a world presented by us.

142
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,280
We put all traditions, customs, customs, structures,

143
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,240
city, state, history, possibilities of development, roles, social castes into it.

144
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,520
And each player creates his own avatar, his own character.

145
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,280
Of course, you can create more than one,

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,640
each character can be introduced in a completely different way and have a different story.

147
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,200
And it's not like everyone is nameless,

148
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,480
that he has some kind of a top-down scenario prepared that he has to go through.

149
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,440
Absolutely not.

150
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,200
In such brutal words, it's a bit of a life simulator,

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,160
I won't say in the Middle Ages, but in the universe created by us in the Gothic universe.

152
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,480
If there are already several RP servers, what will Veritas stand out for?

153
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,440
The servers that were created, and of course I do not diminish them in any way,

154
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,120
because I think that the definition of entertainment is that the player has fun

155
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,840
and maybe someone else's way of playing and playing roleplay is more suitable.

156
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,880
However, if we notice the projects that have been created so far,

157
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,400
these are such mixes, I would call them roleplay and MMORPG,

158
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,880
where we have all the mechanics of exp,

159
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,400
how to level up on singleplayer, how to develop these statistics,

160
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,160
how to do some quests on singleplayer, even some conversations with NPCs.

161
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,320
We, on the other hand, as I said, we depart from this mix

162
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,560
and return to this pure gameplay resulting from the interaction between players,

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,520
between groups of players and such a more narrative than mechanical MMO.

164
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,400
I think that we definitely have something that has been rarely seen for the past few years,

165
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,280
if at all.

166
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,320
For sure, here we want to introduce our own fighting system,

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,280
which completely deviates from the basic one that we saw in Gothic 1 or 2.

168
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,800
Unlock the camera scene so that the player, like in GTA,

169
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,160
could freely look around the character,

170
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,680
and of course changing a little bit the movement of the character itself.

171
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,480
And this is definitely one of such innovative things.

172
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:26,840
The second, probably, big element is our integration between the website and the game itself,

173
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,920
where we put a lot of things aside so that in real time they just communicate with each other,

174
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,320
if we want to ban someone, remove,

175
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,680
and also whether there is a leader of some group, whether it is a criminal one,

176
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,920
or something like that, they want to change something, add some ranks to their structures.

177
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,080
Well, it all works in real time and it is definitely something that has not been done on a larger scale yet.

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,920
Okay, so basically, how much of the map is ready at the moment?

179
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,720
When it comes to the map, the model of the map itself is already finished,

180
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,280
except that we still have to make some minor corrections,

181
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,000
where and where you have to put collisions, add some visible walls so that the player does not come across the map,

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,800
but these are rather such finishing touches rather than adding some new terrain or something,

183
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,120
so in this regard, the map is finished,

184
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,760
only its ovaling remained,

185
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,880
that is, adding all these static objects in the form of trees, benches, some other smaller decorations.

186
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,800
And now it reminds me more of a game in the Sims,

187
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,520
we have a man with a shovel, who actually goes in after hours and puts these shovels on the map.

188
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:39,080
As for the ovaling itself at the moment, if I count correctly, we have 4 districts ready,

189
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,800
5 is slowly finished,

190
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,560
and there will be 4 more,

191
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
due to the fact that the map has also been completed,

192
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,160
we will be able to delegate a little more people to ovaling than to make models of buildings or maps,

193
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
so it should also speed up.

194
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
The map, the model itself is ready,

195
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,240
only it still needs to be polished a bit.

196
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,320
Model + textures, of course, now we are talking about our main map.

197
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,280
Yes, yes, yes, exactly, model + textures.

198
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,200
And what about the area outside the city?

199
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,360
Residents must finally get food from somewhere.

200
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,200
They will not be dependent on the trade with the neighbors.

201
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,600
An important aspect is that we are not an island,

202
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,400
Veritas is located on the continent, we are in the southern part of Myrtana.

203
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,960
The Veritas principality is in the vassal state of Myrtana,

204
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,840
but with a very large autonomy, with its own army, with its own politicians, etc.

205
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,560
As for the out-of-town areas, they are quite limited, as you can also see on the map.

206
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,360
But the vast majority, not to mention 90% of the map, is the whole city and it is a target.

207
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,400
As for these out-of-town areas, we have a rock shelf in the western part of the city,

208
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,960
where there is an amphitheater, a subordinate to the crown, and a beach.

209
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:03,160
As for the north, we left classic farms, grain farms and dense forests there.

210
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:12,120
And this is a bias towards players who want to introduce something to their gameplay with hunting or farming.

211
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,520
Looking at all this, I couldn't help but ask one more question.

212
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,920
Looking at the scope of your project, the effort you put into creating all this,

213
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,160
you make a big, complicated city, armor and even a music path,

214
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,000
it's hard for me to stop and not ask you if your ambitions are not reaching even further.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,960
Have you thought about releasing any story modifications?

216
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:38,120
I think that everyone who does Gothic, sooner or later, has such a thought.

217
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,240
However, at the moment I do not want to reveal anything more,

218
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,240
but in the future, maybe someone knows, something may appear.

219
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,360
At the moment, we are focusing on getting to this project, i.e. the multiplayer server.

220
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,640
If there are any desires, we will not rule out that something else may appear.

221
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,800
I guess it's hard to estimate when the server will start.

222
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,880
As I said before, it's hard to estimate the project as a whole for a very simple reason.

223
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,760
The project is divided into several teams that work autonomously,

224
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,160
and everyone progresses at their own pace.

225
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,000
This results from many things, either from the complexity of tasks, their difficulties,

226
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,080
or from the number of people involved, so in fact also the processing power.

227
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,880
So it's hard to say for sure, progress in some calculated percentage.

228
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,760
However, I can say that we do everything to release it as soon as possible,

229
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,760
with the same behavior, as high quality.

230
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,560
And it rather depends on the fact that at the start,

231
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,880
no one feels discomfort resulting from any shortcomings on our part.

232
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,320
Finally, I would like to add that Veritas will be present at this year's CD Action Expo in Łódź at the beginning of June,

233
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,120
and in the same month at Pyrkon in Poznań.

234
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,000
And what can we expect from them at these events?

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,400
As for CD Action Expo, we cordially invite all fans or those interested in our project.

236
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,560
At the CD Action Expo itself, we will have 6 computer stands,

237
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,800
where everyone will be able to sit down and see what the project looks like at the moment.

238
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,280
We will be able to visit our map or test systems that are already ready,

239
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,560
and we decided to release them for this demo version.

240
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,280
However, as for Pyrkon, as for CD Action Expo, there will also be 6 computer stands,

241
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,240
where you can test what I have already mentioned.

242
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,520
Perhaps something new will appear in these two weeks, which we will add to the whole.

243
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,760
But apart from that, we have the pleasure of conducting 3 pre-lectures.

244
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,280
One will be about our project "Veritas in the world of Gothic",

245
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,040
where we will tell you exactly what the work with the project looks like,

246
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,320
how each of the sections works, what novelties and technical and artistic are related.

247
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,560
The second pre-lecture, a little smaller, will be about the expansion of the Gothic world.

248
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,520
It will tell you what we at Veritas do to make this Gothic world,

249
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:05,800
despite 20 years and hundreds of mods, make the game fresh and attractive for the player.

250
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,800
And the third, smallest pre-lecture will be about the architecture of the Gothic world in 2D and 3D.

251
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,040
We cordially invite each of you.

252
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,280
In this case, I have nothing left but to wish the Veritas team good luck

253
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,920
and keep your fingers crossed for the ingenuity of the project.

254
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,120
In the description of the film, you will be able to find a link to the Discord server,

255
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,720
where those interested will be able to get to know their project better

256
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,160
and to Patronite if someone wants to support them.

257
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,360
That's all I had to present to you in today's video.

258
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,200
Be sure to let me know in the comments what you think about the Veritas RP project.

259
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,280
And besides, I invite you to subscribe, like and support the channel.

260
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,320
In the description, you will also find links to my Facebook and TikTok.

261
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,120
Bye!

262
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:55,960
