What's going on, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
I checked a few forecasts from the year before, which were set for 2022, and few of them turned out to be prophetic.
Well, for example, the inflation forecast. Even the president of the National Bank of Poland was wrong.
I think it's quite typical. Why else?
Because he's an expert.
Yes, some say that, but I say that there is a lot of pressure on most of the experts I know from most of the areas I have contact with.
Even financial influence cases are documented on the position, opinion or decision of experts.
And I don't think it should be a shock to anyone.
Before we get to the topic, it's time to introduce our guest, and he is and will be our weekly guest, Mariusz Stefaniak.
A man who connects many fields, both as a practitioner and as a theorist.
Economist, financialist, manager, among other large IT companies, marketing specialist, and most of all, the president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Let's pay attention to the name - ""Więcej Mądrości"".
Every week we will meet regularly and talk about the economy and the complexity of the world.
Good morning, Mr. Mariusz.
Hello, I bow.
Let's get back to the topic.
An example of a wrong forecast is the housing market.
It was supposed to develop infinitely, prices were supposed to rise, demand was supposed to rise, and here it suddenly turns out that not so much.
Yes, this is a beautiful example.
Why were these forecasts so optimistic in this case?
Optimistic? There is only one answer, because this is what you earn.
And you earn huge money.
Please note that the real estate market is one of the most profitable markets in the world.
Developers earn, landowners earn, good business.
Governments earn, sir.
This is probably the most important.
A great example, for example, such an extreme, but the largest in the world, are China.
One day we can talk about it in detail, I will show the whole mechanism, a shocking mechanism, I assume for the majority.
For me, a completely standard thing in this industry.
I am saving topic number one for the next edition.
But we also have the cryptocurrency market, which has grown incredibly and it seemed that it would also grow all the time.
Yes, the forecasts were amazing.
I remember forecasts that said that in 2022 Bitcoin would cost 120, 140, 150 thousand dollars.
Well, how much it costs today, it's easy to see.
The mechanism itself, ladies and gentlemen, and it's easy to notice a certain scheme, because you make great money on it.
On recording something that we can safely call speculative banks.
But someone goes, someone else buys, agrees, accepts these prices.
So what, we have on the one hand, the players, and on the other hand, the sheep that go where they are told?
Exactly, you know it well.
This is how you can emphasize all events in the history of the world.
Sheep go to slaughter, and the shepherd benefits from it.
But let's get back to the topic of experts who predict and not always or rarely do they come across these predictions.
Do we have bad experts or do we have experts who work on someone else's order, not necessarily those who listen to them?
We definitely have good experts in the world and they are brilliant people, great specialists.
But a completely strange coincidence is not the people who are most liked and promoted by the government, the media or large corporations.
They can't get through with their message to the mass media, to public information.
Yes, because this message warns the sheep that they are going to slaughter.
Well, the shepherd can't like such a message, please forgive me, no shepherd will agree to someone who will warn the sheep before entering the slaughterhouse.
Well, because they will rebel.
Well, or they will go the other way, because it will suddenly turn out that the shepherd cannot handle hundreds of thousands of sheep at once.
Unless the sheep will follow the sheep that leads them.
Well, Mr. Marysia, but maybe we live in very unpredictable times, maybe it was simply not possible to predict the war and the attack of Russia on Ukraine.
Well, the facts speak differently, sir.
The facts that have been documented beyond any doubt are that at least 7 months earlier, the largest governments had 100% certain data on the attack.
What will it be, how will it be, where will it be? These are the facts. It was even half-published.
It didn't get to the public opinion.
It did, you just have to know where to read it.
At this point, we will take a short break, we will be back after a moment of music.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz? We're back on the air. Our guest is an economist, a financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Mr. Mariusz, one of the examples of events, actually global events, which dominated the world public opinion for a very long time and suddenly stopped, is the COVID pandemic.
Two years ago, it was number one on all news, everyone was afraid of the pandemic. Suddenly, we stopped being afraid of it.
Is COVID still a real threat? Was it a real threat to us?
It was, without a doubt, but not as people believed.
What do you mean?
I mean, COVID was and is a deadly threat, but economically, financially, socially, that's its main, crushing, deadly force.
But the virus attacks humans, not the economy.
You're right, but from what I know, we absorb a huge amount of viruses every day and somehow we live. And you've known that for thousands, thousands, thousands of years.
And if you checked the scientific facts, what I did at the beginning of the pandemic, because I didn't know either, of course, I'm not an omnibus, so I learned.
And what I saw solved most of the questions for the next two years.
But I can also show you exactly what I did, how I did it and how I ended up.
Because it's slowly coming out and it's coming out on a gigantic scale. And it will be coming out for at least another year, that's for sure.
So let him tell you a little more.
For example, I will give you simple facts that are published again, so I will be able to verify what I say very quickly.
For example, in a mysterious way, contracts with the largest companies that have received vaccines around the world have disappeared.
And officials from the European Union are not able to present contracts on the basis of which they bought and introduced vaccines to the circulation.
They even forced people to take it, at least they persuaded, and at times they forced.
And now they are not able to show these documents on the basis of which they did it.
And in other countries similar things are happening.
And please believe me that this is only going to get deeper.
In addition, there were also evident financial links between the most important officials who were responsible for implementing these regulations,
again with the same companies that were making money on it.
And these are documented things.
Another fact that has already been published is that some governors in the United States have already officially submitted a report on the pursuit,
the explanation of the pursuit of the COVID-19 curfew,
that is, the introduction of dangerous substances into circulation,
which could and are fully aware that they were introduced,
with full awareness that they could cause damage, even deaths,
and it was associated with corruption.
So these are things that, in my opinion, will dominate at the beginning of 2023,
because people will be outraged by this lethargy,
that governments were taking care of their safety by introducing radical regulations that are in contradiction,
such as, for example, in Poland with the Constitution,
with the regulations of the higher order,
with the limitation of freedom,
the right to move,
the right to conduct economic activity.
After all, you certainly know that almost all prohibitions, prohibitions and penalties were later annulled by the courts,
because they were inconsistent with the law.
As a contradiction with the Constitution.
So what, we're going back to the sheep herd scheme again,
which are mindlessly following the voice of the shepherd,
and the shepherd is not merciful to them?
Yes, and some kill. Exactly.
This is not the only thing that will probably dominate in 2023.
There are other international problems that are less heard about in Poland,
we talk less about it,
but things are happening in the world arena that may have a very strong impact on us soon.
For example, the situation in China.
What happened there?
Yes, we have to pay special attention to China in 2023,
because in my opinion it will have an impact on the whole world.
On many levels.
Of course, as an economist, I will pay the most attention to these economic aspects,
but as a human being I will also look very carefully at political ones,
including those related to the outbreak of even some conflict.
You are talking about a military conflict.
Let's face it.
I would not like to use the words ""World War III"",
but such thoughts may come to mind.
At this point, we will take a short break,
we will be back after a moment of music.

Our guest is an economist, financier, expert Mariusz Stefaniak.
We felt that the war is quite possible after the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine.
For us, it appeared, for example, with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
So we see that it can have an impact on each of us.
Well, here I would like to debunk a myth.
And it's such a terrifying myth and widely believed to be true.
Number one. Currently, there are the most wars in the history of the world.
So it has never been as bad in the world as in recent years.
And contrary to what people think,
it was the time when pro-peaceful international organs were formed.
This should make you think.
Secondly, the gigantic concentration of power in one hand or in a small amount of hands
is usually a reason for anxiety or at least for very careful observation of this person who decides.
The truth is that people who currently hold power are not controlled by anyone.
Not only that, most of them are not even elected by people.
A classic example is the EU authorities.
Did you elect them?
Do you know who elected them, who decides who rules Europe?
Well, it's a very complicated system of indirect elections.
Representatives elect other representatives and so on and so forth.
At some point, you lose complete control over it.
Well, again, one of my important parts of my professional life is being an expert when it comes to European finance, European funds.
For many years, I have been teaching at graduate schools, I am the author of a book,
one of the first in Poland, written jointly with people from the Ministry,
on the subject of funds, the implementation of European funds.
So I also assume that I can speak quite sensibly in this area.
Believe me, the number of things, the number of absurdities,
which a normal person is not even able to believe, and which are of course a fact,
I also learned it directly from the European Parliamentarians,
because I was there, of course, I talked, I was there.
And believe me, it looks completely different than you could ever guess,
judging by leaks or some media information.
Most authorities look different if you are close to these authorities.
So please believe me, people don't know a lot of things.
A lot of things that fundamentally change the whole world view.
Well, I say, I am so lucky that my professional life is very closely related to business, finance,
and often, unfortunately, also with politics.
I say unfortunately, because what I have learned, what I have learned, has very, very, very changed my approach to it.
And I generally laugh that I have no political views.
Because I met people so highly positioned, so close, most of whom I know from TV,
that I look at political views completely differently.
At least political decisions.
And again, economic knowledge goes into the abyss.
The old Latin saying, ""If you want to reach the truth, follow the path of money.""
And this is a good advice, in my opinion, for every listener.
A short poem to sum up today's audition.
The old year is over.
Time to sum up.
Where are the gains and increases?
Bitcoins?
Apartments?
Losses?
War, crisis, fuel prices are rising.
I have enough promises.
I think I'm getting smarter.
This will also be the goal of our audition.
To talk about things that people don't quite understand, and often these are completely hidden matters.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you for the first time.
I hope we managed to interest and encourage the listeners.
We will be on the air again in a week.
This is ""Grany"", Mr. Mariusz.
Until next time.
Once again, our guest was an economist, financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Thank you very much.
The audition was conducted by Krzysztof Strauchman.

C:/Users/G/Documents/GitHub/audycje.com.pl/content/audio\CJG_02_2023_01_21.mp3,"**1. Key Themes**
   - The text discusses the current state of the cinema industry, highlighting significant losses incurred by major studios and the impact of big-budget productions on audience expectations and satisfaction.
   - It also touches upon the manipulation of public opinion by powerful companies, which can lead to a disconnect between perceived success and actual reception by viewers and independent experts.
   - The text explores the broader implications of these trends on mass culture and the economy.

**2. Impacts**
   - **Economic**: Major studios are facing significant losses from big-budget productions, leading to a potential decline in market value and investment opportunities.
   - **Technological**: The text does not directly address technological impacts, but it implies that advancements in production quality do not necessarily translate into better audience reception.
   - **Political**: There is no direct political impact discussed, though the manipulation of public opinion by powerful entities can have broader societal consequences.
   - **Social**: The text highlights a growing disconnect between the corporate narrative and the views of ordinary viewers and independent experts, which can erode trust in mainstream media and cultural institutions.

**3. Examples and Evidence**
   - The example of ""Rings of Power"" from Tolkien's world illustrates how a highly anticipated and expensive production can fail to meet audience expectations despite being marketed as successful.
   - The series based on Sapkowski's Witcher universe is another case where corporate interference led to a poor reception by fans, who saw it as mocking the original work.

**4. Opportunities and Risks**
   - **Opportunities**: There is an opportunity for independent creators and smaller studios to gain traction if they focus on quality and authenticity rather than massive budgets.
   - **Risks**: The current trend could lead to a further decline in the cinema industry, affecting jobs and economic stability. It also risks eroding public trust in media and cultural institutions due to perceived manipulation.

**5. Conclusion**
   - The text suggests that the cinema industry is at a crossroads where the focus on massive budgets and corporate narratives may not align with audience expectations and values.
   - Future considerations should prioritize authenticity, genuine storytelling, and respect for viewers' intelligence to restore trust and ensure the longevity of the industry.","['tesla', 'Tesla', 'China', 'Cinema', 'Finance', 'radio', 'cinema', 'Crisis', 'Culture', 'products', 'cars', 'China', 'Cinema', 'Books', 'Crisis', 'Movies', 'Market', 'Wealth', 'economics', 'success', 'Economics', 'investors', 'Crisis', 'Debt', 'Companies', 'Economy', 'absurdity', 'money', 'World', 'market', 'Entertainment', 'Deficit', 'accounts', 'Economy', 'Failure', 'Economy', 'TradeWar', 'media', 'USA', 'Markets', 'economics', 'actors', 'Absurdity', 'Money', 'advertising', 'corruption', 'china', 'www', 'Losses', 'threats', 'Culture', 'absurdist', 'adaptation""', '""abuse', 'Amazon']","﻿1

What's going on Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
In Business Insider I read that 8 American billionaires lost almost $ 400 billion in total last year.
I wonder how you can lose such money.
They drank it, someone stole it, took it, invested badly, went bankrupt. What happened?
Good question. Because, indeed, such amounts are falling and I have seen such calculations.
Not only that, I would add that it looks even more interesting.
Because, for example, the Kilon Mask estate has decreased by more than half.
So these are not just the billions that are abstract for all of us,
but we are talking about the fact that one of the richest people in the world lost half of his property.
Literally in a dozen months.
The same goes for Jeff Bezos and many others.
We are talking about the world's largest companies.
We are not talking about, as you say, bad investments and so on.
No, no, no.
We are talking about their leading key businesses suddenly falling in value.
How do you estimate the value of such people's assets?
Taking it literally from space.
It is not based on a hard number. Someone says accounting is a very mathematical thing.
In this case, unfortunately, not at all.
Because how to estimate real estate in Manhattan?
How do you calculate it exactly?
How do we know how much it is worth?
Do you calculate the value of bricks?
No. I can compare it to the values of similar real estate sold before.
Or the needs and possibilities of people who would like to buy.
In short, we are talking about demand and sale.
This is a classic case. How much is a bottle of Coca-Cola worth?
As much as someone who buys wants to pay.
Yes. If you offer me this bottle in the desert when I die of thirst, it will be worth all the money.
It is exactly the same with these prices.
Of course, it is not as dramatic as with Coca-Cola.
But sometimes psychology plays the most important role in prices.
There are companies that are trendy.
In the style of Tesla, it happened.
And suddenly its shares skyrocketed several dozen times.
Shares that were worth $ 10-15 in 2019, then began to be worth $ 100-200-300-400.
These are absurd values.
And now the question is what happened?
For a year or two with this company, it has grown from $ 10 to $ 400 per share.
What happened? It became popular.
But what happened now? It is losing.
They started to produce something that did not go into the market.
They made a mistake. Such money does not go away for no reason.
You are right. They do not go away for no reason.
There are many reasons.
I will give one. China.
Tesla invested huge amounts of money in mega factories in China.
And then it would seem that it is a brilliant move.
Today, when there were lockdowns, strikes, and now China is closing in on the US economy,
the so-called trade war between China and the US,
at this point, this Tesla factory in China is rather a burden, a problem, than a profit.
Investors are not idiots.
Not all, but most investors are not idiots.
So they noticed it all.
For example, one detail.
The lack of battery availability.
Tension on the Taiwan-China line.
Because it may suddenly turn out that we will not have chips, we will not have batteries for all these devices.
The same with Apple.
A big strike of the factory in China.
Exactly in the Apple factory in China.
And at this point, suddenly, what is a company worth that cannot produce anything?
Because there is nowhere.
And what control does it have over it?
The answer is exactly none.
Because it is decided by the Chinese government, and what happened in China.
They have no influence on it.
That's what it's about.
This is one aspect.
The second aspect is that, what I have repeatedly signaled for years,
against the opinion of the media,
that there is a huge crisis.
Finally, what I have been saying since 2018, very loudly,
is that it is now reaching the public space.
And people say, ""Damn, there is a huge crisis.""
So, indicators of all industries are falling.
All tech industries are going down.
Of course, they are not going down so terribly, as we say here,
that, I don't know, about half and so on.
No, no, no.
But it still shows that these are symptoms of a certain threat.
Such black clouds that are gathering.
Investors also don't like it.
Because the future doesn't look bright for them.
So this is the second aspect.
Because in 2022, miracles happened.
The shares went up?
Damn.
Don't look for sense there, because it's a pity for the West.
Before you buy shares, put your head in the ice.
At this point, we will take a short break.
We will be back after a moment of music.

We're back to our broadcast.
Once again, we have Mariusz Stefaniak in front of us.
Economist, financier, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
Mr. Mariusz, what's going on?
We talked about the fact that billionaires, Americans, lost a huge fortune,
but the prices of the shares of the most famous American companies also fell.
Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Apple, Meta.
Giants, entertainment.
What's going on?
We stop watching TV.
Is this a sign of a crisis?
Has the crisis affected only a few industries?
Indeed, this has not been observed in recent years.
Needless to say, the entertainment industry has experienced a boom.
Especially in recent decades.
These were amazing years for them.
Of course, during the pandemic, cinemas were closed in the United States.
We did not feel it that way, but Americans rely heavily on the cinema network.
It's a different culture, so it works differently for them.
Big companies earn a significant part of their wealth by distributing cinema tickets.
These are hundreds of millions of dollars from one movie.
It's a lot of money, even for them.
It was a breakthrough year in 2022, because the biggest productions,
the biggest film studios stopped making money and started to bring significant losses.
We are talking about losses of $200 million.
We are talking about such amounts from one movie.
Indeed, it is shocking and there are quite a few reasons for this.
Please start counting, because I'm curious what you mean.
A classic example, which was a breakthrough example, was ""Rings of Power"" from Tolkien's world.
The previous releases from this world were the biggest hits in the history of cinema.
We are talking about screenings made by Peter Jackson.
And here, suddenly, the biggest company, Amazon, and Amazon Studio,
put out an unprecedented amount of money in the industry.
Almost a billion dollars for one movie.
This has never been seen, even in Hollywood, with the biggest productions.
What turned out?
That it was a total crushing, terrifying blow.
But it's even deeper, because they announced a success.
All the media claimed that it was an incredible success,
that it was the number one hit in the world,
that for the next few decades people would be delighted with what they had created.
But this was a violent dispute with the opinions of people like us, ordinary viewers,
and independent experts, who are not too many,
they are not particularly loud, but they are great experts,
who do not appear in mainstream media.
And there was a very brutal fight between a gigantic company,
which, to put it brutally, paid, bought, you could say, critics,
and even bought out all the companies that evaluate movies,
ranking these movies.
They just bought these products and put out the best opinions.
You understand the absurdity of this situation.
But this is the standard in the industry at the moment.
Of course, people were watching this until a moment,
when something so terribly expected came out.
It was incredibly strong here.
That people were expecting something brilliant,
and waited a few years for the production to be produced,
and they knew that the money put into it would be unprecedented,
so they were expecting something monumental, you know.
When you invest several times more money in the same product,
you say, ""Oh, this product will be much better.""
So you buy a car, you have a Skoda,
and now a Skoda will come out, which they put, let's say,
five times as much money to produce.
It comes out and you say, ""Damn, but this is a bargain,
it's not even comparable to the Skoda I had, which was five times cheaper.""
It's just a bargain.
And you get pissed off.
Alfira says, ""No, no, this is the best car in the world,
you should be happy, but I'm pissed off at you.""
And exactly that was the case.
But then a whole wave of similar situations followed.
A classic example from our backyard,
Sapkowski and Wiedźmin, one of the coolest brands
that came out of Poland and became a leading world brand in the entertainment sphere.
And again, a powerful company made a series out of it
and just destroyed, destroyed in a scandalous way
Sapkowski's brilliant creativity,
the brilliant achievement of our gaming studio,
which promoted Polish culture, history and Polish stories.
And suddenly the fans went mad.
Even the leading actor who played Geralt of Rivia left.
In a sign of protest that they were destroying,
so they were laughing, apparently, those who created this series,
they were laughing at Sapkowski's book, they were laughing at our production.
They were just getting drunk from what they had created.
You know, such absurdities.
And it's not just about the books, it's about the movies you mentioned.
We can literally go through them one by one
and you'll find out that they're just laughing at their own clients.
They say they're idiots, nerds, naive, stupid.
And you know, you can see that approach.
And people at some point stopped accepting it,
which at the same time resulted in, as we mentioned in the previous segment,
a general decline in the market.
And that's the situation we're in.
Mr. Mariusz, I think we'll discuss the topic of what's happening in mass culture,
how it affects the economy and the situation in the world
in our next meeting,
where I'm already inviting our listeners
on Saturday and Sunday at 10.30,
which is played by our guest, Mariusz Stefaniak,
economist, financier, president of the Fundacja Więcej Mądrości.
Thank you very much for the meeting and for the conversation.
Thank you very much and I also invite our listeners. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Krzysztof Strauchman.

C:/Users/G/Documents/GitHub/audycje.com.pl/content/audio\CJG_03_2023_01_28.mp3,"### Key Themes

The text discusses several interconnected themes:
1. **Film Industry Standards**: The comparison between previous films by Peter Jackson and the new adaptation of ""The Ring of Power"" highlights disparities in critical reception and audience satisfaction.
2. **Diversity and Inclusion**: The presence of black actors, homosexuals, and transhuman characters in fantasy movies is explored, with a focus on how these inclusions are perceived by audiences.
3. **Ideological Influences**: The impact of political and ideological agendas on the selection of cast and crew, reminiscent of historical practices like the appointment of political commissars.
4. **Audience Backlash**: The frustration and rebellion of fans due to perceived forced diversity and poor quality content driven by ideological motivations rather than artistic merit.

### Impacts

The broader impacts of these themes include:
1. **Economic**: Financial investments in films are at risk when audience reception is poor, as seen with ""The Ring of Power"" where viewership had to be incentivized.
2. **Technological**: No direct technological impact is mentioned, but the discussion could influence future content creation practices and platforms' strategies for audience engagement.
3. **Political**: The text hints at a politicization of the film industry, with certain ideologies influencing casting decisions, which can polarize audiences.
4. **Social**: The inclusion of diverse characters should foster social acceptance but can backfire if not handled authentically, leading to accusations of tokenism and poor representation.

### Examples and Evidence

Real-world examples include:
1. **Critical Reception Disparity**: The stark difference in ratings between Jackson's previous films (91% critic, 95% viewer) and ""The Ring of Power"" (38% viewer, 85% critic).
2. **Viewership Incentives**: Amazon paying viewers to watch due to poor initial reception indicates a failure in engaging audiences organically.
3. **Historical Parallels**: The comparison with political commissars highlights how ideological conformity can supersede artistic merit.
4. **Audience Rebellion**: Fans rebelling against perceived propaganda and low-quality content due to ideologically driven casting choices.

### Opportunities and Risks

Opportunities:
1. **Inclusive Storytelling**: Authentic inclusion of diverse characters can enrich stories and broaden audience appeal.
2. **Audience Engagement**: Better understanding and addressing audience expectations can lead to more successful productions.

Risks:
1. **Ideological Backlash**: Forced diversity and ideological conformity risk alienating audiences and leading to backlash.
2. **Financial Losses**: Poorly received films can result in significant financial losses, as seen with ""The Ring of Power.""
3. **Creative Constraints**: Prioritizing ideology over artistic merit may stifle creativity and limit the potential of productions.

### Conclusion

The implications suggest a need for balance between diversity and authentic storytelling. Producers should focus on selecting cast and crew based on talent rather than ideological fit. Future considerations should include better audience research to understand what viewers expect from inclusive content, thereby avoiding potential backlash and ensuring financial viability. Achieving this balance will likely result in more successful productions that authentically represent diverse experiences while maintaining high artistic standards.","['radio', '""actors', 'World', 'World', 'world', 'EndOfWorld', 'endoftheworld', 'woke', 'filmindustry', 'Movie', 'actors', 'critics', 'ideologies', 'End', 'Film', '""amazon', 'cinema', '""tvseries""', 'Economics', 'Ideology', 'filmindustry', 'woke', 'Propaganda', 'oppression', 'Money', 'ideology', 'BoxOffice', 'Film', 'Politics', 'apocalypse', 'apocalypse', 'propaganda', '""productioncosts""', 'economy', 'Apocalypse', 'Apocalypse', 'Power', 'War', 'Economy', 'hollywood', 'cinema', 'politics', '""amazon""', 'Rating', 'views""', 'directors', 'failure', 'movies', 'financialresults', 'Culture', 'Crisis', 'Doomsday', 'Crisis', 'earnings', 'culture', 'media', 'ideology', 'region', 'ideology', 'advertising', 'money', 'entertainment', 'investors', 'absurdity', 'Amazon', 'diversity', 'Economy', 'culture', 'Aging', 'Fantasy', 'Money', 'Economy', 'Market', 'implementation', 'Economics', 'absurdity', 'amazon', 'funding""', 'Money', 'Culture', 'Amazon']","﻿1

What's the deal, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
To be honest, I was inspired by our conversation from a week ago
about how unsuccessful TV series produced in recent or previous years
affect the course of action of large companies producing movies.
I started looking for data on the Internet about the number of viewers and ticket inflows
of the famous series ""The Ring of Power"".
While Amazon, the producer, boasted a lot before the distribution of this series
how much it invested in its production,
that it cost a record $1 billion in the history of cinema,
it's hard to find enough data about how much it earned.
Is it a sign that the movie was a financial flop?
It doesn't necessarily have to be a sign, but it gives a disturbing signal.
That something is wrong.
If we have something to boast about, why don't we boast?
Because we are modest.
No, we know that Amazon Studio and Jeff Bezos are not modest people.
They love to boast about their successes, their numbers, achievements.
So it makes you think. You're right.
Especially since in previous series or movies that were cash successes
they were officially stated how much they earned
and they earned several times more than their production cost.
This one should earn several billion dollars.
Yes, it definitely is.
There were even announcements, sometimes even a little exaggerated,
because they claimed that 60 years after the release of ""Rings of Power""
it will be a hit and people will watch it.
So I think it will be a mega hit for decades.
And as you mentioned, the very look at the predecessor sets a high bar.
For example, in 2004, ""The Lord of the Rings"" won 11 Oscars.
So in all categories nominated.
It's impressive.
All three parts won 30 nominations, of which 17.
So let's admit it's a high bar.
In terms of money, money is also impressive.
Let's say that for the invested 93 million dollars in ""Fellowship of the Ring""
which is the first part,
this part earned something over 377 million dollars.
And it was the same with every other part.
The first trilogy earned about 300-380 million dollars.
Every part.
There were also additional parts, extended versions, etc.
Each of them also earned millions of dollars.
The same with ""The Hobbit"", which was the smallest part
and also artificially divided from one book into a trilogy.
It also earned an average of 250 million dollars per part.
These are gigantic amounts.
We're talking about the fact that from a small amount of money
the company earned a billion dollars from the tickets themselves.
Where they invested 90 million dollars for the film.
It's impressive, let's be honest.
So the expectations for ""Rings of Power"" were gigantic.
Mr. Mariusz, we should start with the explanation.
We owe it to our listeners.
The point is to show why the film industry is different from other types of industries.
Steel production, car production.
What is this business different from? Why is it so important?
A good question.
It's important because of the amount of money in the media business.
Entertainment, as they call it.
Broadly speaking, entertainment.
But the key to the puzzle is not here.
Because it's a socially important business.
Because it shapes people's minds and views.
Which affects all their life decisions.
It shapes the whole country and society.
And the powers of this world know it perfectly and use it effectively.
So it's about power and propaganda.
Not just about pure money.
He called it a bunch of crap, but it's true.
It's about power and propaganda.
We'll take a break and be back in a moment.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation,
financial economist.
And the topic of our conversation today is
the situation of the film industry
and how successful or unsuccessful productions
affect the financial results of companies.
But not only. Mr. Mariusz, we talked about
the ""Ring of Power"" series
produced by Amazon.
And what is it like compared to other superproductions
from the last year?
Did they also make such spectacular hits?
Well, the answer is not unambiguous.
Because I personally found a common denominator
that perfectly shows
when something will be a hit
and when it will be a success.
What were the gigantic hits?
The ""Ring of Power"" series
is definitely at the top.
Because it was a breakthrough
on many levels of the phenomenon.
What else was so incredibly unsuccessful?
Undoubtedly, ""The Witcher"".
Sarah the Witcher,
who is known and loved
all over the world,
was so terribly disfigured
that the audience
was massively running away.
Including the main character,
Henry Cavill,
who simply gave up
the gigantic money
he earned there.
This is, of course, a classic example
of Star Wars,
one of the biggest sagas
in the history of cinema,
which, from part to part,
was an increasing disappointment.
It also led the audience
to fury.
What was done with this great title.
A great universe
created by George Lucas.
But of course,
it is not so unambiguous.
Because there are the freshest productions.
""Maverick"" with Tom Cruise,
which is a great success.
""Avatar"", which earns billions
at the same time as other companies
lose billions.
So what is the common denominator
of all these films?
Exactly. That's why I asked myself
such a question, analyzing the economic results.
And you know what I came to?
The answer is simple. Ideology.
Ideology is a common denominator, sir.
These films were dominated
by ideology?
Yes. And this specific ideology.
In Poland we do not have
such a word, but in the West
it is called ""woke"". ""Wokeness"".
Well, I heard. It is also penetrating into Poland.
It is slowly adapting
to the current situation.
And this is the key word
to the mystery of economic failures
or profits.
There is such a famous saying
now, a real meme.
""Get woke, go broke"".
So stay woke, i.e. enlightened
and go bankrupt.
The film and entertainment industry
in particular
is a carrier
of certain cultural values.
These richest people,
who actually run these companies.
Let's be honest,
no one poor and average has a film studio
in Hollywood.
And they randomly launch
certain ideologies.
And these ideologies say
that it is a beautiful ideology.
Something like communism.
That everyone is equal.
That we must help people who are excluded.
Who are in the minority.
Who do not have such a voice as you.
Great ideals, right?
Well, the ideals of equality
were always very eagerly heard
and promoted.
And what is the practice of implementing these ideals?
I found a short definition
of the woke ideology.
That it is not equality, but it is an obsession.
Obsession on the point of gender,
on the point of sexual orientation
or climate change.
So this is something that is totally
overwritten.
Yes, because at the beginning
all ideologies, if you look at the history
of the communist era, we want
the oppressed workers not to be oppressed.
That these great scammers
were not such tyrants.
They did not steal people.
After all, we want everyone to live better.
Beautiful.
But let's look at the implementation
of this in practice.
Hundreds of millions of victims,
destroyed houses, culture, society,
bloody slaughter.
This is what the implementation of these beautiful slogans
looks like in practice.
We will come back to you in a moment.

The previous iteration of Peter Jackson's beloved movie had a rating level, I quote here from one of the most famous and respected rating portals, 91% in the critic's rating and 95% in the viewer's rating.
So practically perfect, almost perfect, almost everyone was delighted.
Let's put it together with the Ring of Power, sir. You have 38% here for the plus from the point of view of the viewers and 85% of the critics.
Of course, it came out very brutally, because people say that the critics are blind, they did not watch the same as we did.
It turns out that these are just bought reviews.
Brutally. In addition, there were such paradoxes that Amazon began to buy viewers in some countries to start watching, because the results of the viewing were so terrible, they are so terrible that for a whole week they were not published at all.
And people watched individual episodes.
They started paying viewers for watching because the results were so terrifyingly terrible.
This is something incredible in the film industry. That you pay the viewer to want to see what you have produced, because you want it to be a success so much, and it is such a big failure.
Mr. Mariusz, but we live in an open society, the presence of black actors on the screen, the presence of homosexuals or people playing homosexuals in films is no longer surprising anyone.
What is it about? Why is this a problem for the audience?
I agree, I absolutely agree with you, because I have not heard any opinions that someone has interfered with the fact that someone has put black elves in the Legendarium or black transhuman women and so on.
I have not heard such negative opinions.
But I have heard opinions that, for example, bad actors, bad showrunners, bad directors, bad bosses of studios were put in, because they are elected from the political, ideological key.
It reminds me of the times of political commissars in the socialist union, who, no matter how competent they were as managers or commanders, they always had a decisive voice.
They force people with low competences into us, because they fit the ideology or the denominator, how many percent are supposed to be homosexuals in the film.
Because that's exactly what the percentages are.
How many people are supposed to be of a certain skin color, of a certain minority?
Nobody cares if they are great actors, hopeless or average.
They have to be there, because otherwise the film will not be funded.
And this is really something that drives people mad.
Because not only do they put in weak actors, but if you don't like the film, you'll be called a racist.
And a lot of other adjectives.
And this is exactly what led to, you can say openly, the rebellion of fans, the rebellion of viewers, because they just want good shows.
And not ideological, propaganda, poor quality videos.
That's what it was about.
We have to finish our conversation.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" Foundation.
A financial expert, an economist.
Mr. Mariusz, thank you.
Thank you very much.

C:/Users/G/Documents/GitHub/audycje.com.pl/content/audio\CJG_04_2023_02_04.mp3,"### Key Themes
The text discusses several key themes:

1. **Influence of Giants**: The power of large corporations (giants) to influence politicians, rulers, and officials, shaping regulations in their favor.
2. **Credit and Economic Faith**: The link between taking long-term loans and faith in the future's economic stability.
3. **Lack of Financial Wisdom**: People's tendency to make poor financial decisions due to a lack of economic knowledge and prudence.
4. **Responsibility of Banks**: How banks' lending policies can affect people’s ability to take loans, reflecting the financial climate rather than individual wisdom.
5. **Social Audition for Wisdom**: The need for greater societal wisdom and better decision-making.

### Impacts
The broader impacts discussed in the text encompass various dimensions:

1. **Economic**: The economic impact revolves around credit availability, financial stability, and future economic faith. People's willingness to take loans reflects their belief in the economy's future prospects.
2. **Social**: There is a clear social impact highlighted by the lack of financial wisdom among individuals. This lack of knowledge leads to poor financial decisions and reliance on external factors like banks' lending policies.
3. **Political**: The influence of corporate giants over politicians shapes regulations, leading to an unequal playing field in economic policy-making.
4. **Technological**: While not explicitly stated, the influence of corporate giants may indirectly affect technological advancements and their regulation.

### Examples and Evidence
1. **Corporate Influence**: Real-world examples include large corporations lobbying for favorable regulations, influencing policy to maintain their dominant positions.
2. **Credit Availability**: Banks' willingness to offer preferential loans can drastically affect consumer behavior. When banks tighten lending policies, it restricts people’s access to credit regardless of their individual wisdom or financial literacy.
3. **Lack of Financial Literacy**: The analogy of an alcoholic not buying vodka due to lack of availability rather than personal growth underscores the point that people's financial behavior is influenced by external factors, not just internal knowledge.

### Opportunities and Risks
1. **Opportunities**:
   - **Education and Awareness Campaigns**: Increasing public awareness and providing education on financial literacy can empower individuals to make better decisions.
   - **Policy Reforms**: Addressing the undue influence of corporate giants on policy-making to create a more equitable economic environment.
2. **Risks**:
   - **Economic Downturns**: If people lose faith in the future due to limited credit availability, it can contribute to an economic downturn.
   - **Social Unrest**: A lack of financial wisdom and access to credit can lead to social unrest if people feel disenfranchised by the system.

### Conclusion
The text suggests that individuals' financial decisions are heavily influenced by external factors such as banks' lending policies and regulatory environments shaped by corporate influence. To promote a wiser society, it is crucial to increase public education on economic matters and implement policy reforms that reduce corporate control over regulations. This approach can help foster greater resilience and better decision-making capabilities among individuals in the face of economic uncertainty. Future considerations should include advocating for policies that ensure equitable access to credit and limiting undue corporate influence, thereby enhancing societal wisdom and financial stability.","['Economy', 'Inflation', 'Economy', 'Debt', 'Housing', 'Debt', '""Market', 'astronomy', 'realestate', 'Economy', 'Market', '""Market""', 'debt', 'taxes', 'Corruption', 'economics', 'RealEstateMarket', 'Ukraine', 'realestate', 'economics', 'banks', 'WealthDisparity', 'corporations""', 'Market', 'Regulations', 'Economy', 'wisdom', 'realestate', 'realestate', 'Deficit', 'Market', 'politics', 'markets""', 'faith', 'Lobbying', 'Market', 'economy', 'Market', 'refugees', 'space', 'education', '""apartments', 'money', 'realestate', 'politics', 'money', 'corruption', 'corruption', 'China', 'Money', '""Housing""', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Money', '""Crisis""', 'Bank', 'Advertising', 'alcoholism', 'Economy', 'politics', 'Government""', 'crisis', 'Money', 'housing', 'credit', 'Poland', 'economy', 'Faith', 'accounts', '""ai', 'money', 'Money']","﻿1

What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
And what did you hear there again?
What's the score, Mr. Mariusz?
Our guest is an economist, financial expert, Mariusz Stefaniak.
Mr. Mariusz, I read the information from the Office of Credit Information,
which stated that we have our own ""ice age"" when it comes to housing loans.
In previous years, Poles took housing loans for grant,
and now they don't.
As if they didn't want to build houses or buy flats.
The data of this office show that the amount of loans has fallen
to 30% of what we borrowed a year ago.
Development companies are already crying, literally,
that they won't have anyone to build for in a moment.
However, I have not found any information anywhere
that significant housing prices have dropped,
which should probably happen in this situation.
We talked in August last year,
and you predicted a crisis in the housing market
and you predicted a decrease.
Will these decreases occur?
So yes, let me not agree with these theses.
Poles want to buy flats and want to borrow.
Banks stopped wanting to give them money.
Next.
According to the data I have,
prices are falling for both flats and rent.
For example, I will quote here,
""The rent rates have fallen slightly
after 10 months of continuous increases,
according to the report of Expandera and Rentier.io.
In October, the rent was 9 out of 16 poor cities,
2 out of 16 rates did not change,
and 5 out of 16 further increases were noted.""
Let's read on.
""Thanks to the decline in housing prices,
the average rent of an apartment investment
has increased to 5.54 net,
which is equivalent to a flat with a 6.84% interest rate.""
So if you analyze the numbers on the market,
it turns out that prices are falling.
Of course, if we look even deeper into the data,
it will turn out that last year there were significant increases
resulting from the gigantic inflow of millions of refugees from Ukraine.
So all of this means that despite this abnormal system of things,
because no normal country is able to accept
a few, as we had, 4 million officially Ukrainians
who entered the Polish border,
this is not a normal situation in any country in the world.
And no real estate market could behave well in this situation,
because it is an unhealthy, unnatural situation.
If despite this, at the end of the year,
and here I read the data from December 2022,
it indicates that what I predicted,
I remember that I said that to make it more or less make sense,
the decline should be at the level of 30% of the value of the housing price.
- You said so.
- Yes, I remember that.
So if you look at the current data,
where 4 million people have flown,
that is, people who have to live somewhere,
and despite this, there are drops.
Of course, these drops are after the wave of growth.
Why?
Because 4 million people have flown to rent a flat,
to buy a flat and to rent a flat.
But despite everything, our market was totally unequal.
That is why these prices must fall.
There is no way out.
If the Ukrainians left,
please believe me, what I predicted,
it would be too little to slow down the market crash now.
300% drops would not help.
This is absolutely obvious to me.
- You said that Poles want to take out loans and build apartments,
but banks stopped giving them.
Banks also have to adapt to the situation,
even to inflation and the so-called reference rate
established by the National Bank of Poland,
which is high.
Loans have become expensive.
Is this only the effect of inflation,
or are there other elements to it?
- Inflation has nothing to do with it, to be honest.
Inflation is a key word
to explain to people who have no idea about the economy,
why it is bad in the economy.
One day we can do a whole hearing about inflation
and I assume it will be an incredibly interesting experience for you,
when I present to you scientific facts, economic knowledge,
a little more in-depth than what you hear, see and read.
- What if it's not inflation?
- The topic is very serious and deep,
so it's hard for me to explain it in one sentence,
so that listeners who are not economists can understand it.
Generally speaking, let's say it's an unhealthy market system
and all of this is the effect of it.
It's like the effect of a disease that affects the Polish economy,
and the real estate market in particular.
So this is one of the symptoms.
- We're taking a break here, but we'll be back in a moment.
Please do not leave the radio.

Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
an economist and financial advisor to the Foundation ""Więcej Mądrości"".
Today we're talking about the situation on the real estate market.
A moment ago, Mr. Mariusz said that the situation is structurally unhealthy.
I think the government and the Polish authorities are starting to notice that it's unhealthy,
because they've started to come up with all kinds of ideas to improve the situation.
Among others, the idea of imposing additional fees on companies
that buy flats in bulk, more than once.
This additional fee is supposed to protect Poles who are not able to compete,
at least that's what they're assuming,
and whether it will lead to a drop in the price of a square meter of housing,
because that's probably what it's all about.
- Okay, I'll put it this way.
In my opinion, that's not what it's all about,
because the government doesn't care in any way
and shouldn't care about the drop in the price of housing.
But again, that's a separate topic,
we can go deeper into it some time.
It's better to look at China, for example,
because there it's so exaggerated, so shown on such a scale,
that everything will be perfectly visible.
Then the listeners will quickly transfer this model to the Polish market
and they will understand why what I said makes sense.
It's not about lowering the price of housing at all.
That's one thing.
Secondly, will this stop the domination in any way,
because we're talking about big entities on the real estate market.
Absolutely not.
I can't imagine anyone with any real economic or technical knowledge
being able to believe it.
Because think about it.
For decades, these companies have been buying the best locations,
the best places, because they had practically unlimited capital.
Poles had to do it with credit.
You saw that most of the apartments that were bought were bought on credit.
So people like that will always lose to gigantic multinational corporations.
It's obvious.
And now, again, a simple fact.
We have the highest housing prices in decades.
And think about it.
An experienced investor.
These big companies are experienced investors.
They buy thousands of apartments, sometimes in dozens of different countries.
So only an idiot buys on the so-called ""high"",
only when something is the most expensive.
And the experienced investor buys when something is super cheap.
They did it exactly.
In short, they did the best business they could.
Now, when they are no longer interested in buying, because at these prices it doesn't make much sense for them,
suddenly the government came up with a brilliant idea to limit the people who bought.
But they already bought everything they could, what they wanted.
Nothing blocked them.
The milk was distributed, right?
Cards were distributed.
And now we won't be cheating.
Schuller chose the cards he wanted.
Do you think this is a fair game now?
Really?
Less will be built, but at least more people will buy, ordinary people will buy these apartments.
They won't have competition.
No.
No.
First of all, a simple fact.
Official data already published says that developers are holding investments.
It is literally predicted that there will be a shortage of apartments in the perspective of two years.
This is a cover-up of the Board of Directors of the Polish Development Association.
I think people know what they are talking about, right?
The industry speaks, yes.
This is their business.
Exactly.
So if they already clearly announce that investments are being held,
what I said, that some of the investments were still in flow, some developers had financial resources,
so they could afford to hold them, but I told you that it would end.
Do you remember?
Yes, this is a large industry that is slowing down.
Exactly, because it is a giant.
As if you wanted to stop an elephant.
The elephant does not stop immediately.
Slowing down such a mass takes time.
So here we have exactly such an effect.
But it happened.
They already announced it.
Yes, we are slowing down, we are already closing investments, we are not opening new ones.
These are the facts.
I predicted it a year ago.
And people were shouting, I remember everything on the newspaper headlines,
""No, no, it's temporary, it's developing here, everything will be beautiful.""
No, it won't.
And we meet after a year and it is not.
Mr. Marysia, but the government proposes another solution.
Since the Poles lack money, we will give them the money.
Buy more apartments, we will help you, we will give you a supplement to buy the first apartment,
financing of various types for municipalities that build communal apartments.
More money, just common money, because these are the money from our taxes.
Some people get it, but we will definitely all pay for it.
Can this affect the market situation and the maintenance of this housing and construction HOSS?
It will definitely affect the next patch of our already damaged, sick housing market.
So it will only be another beating of a bullet horse.
Kick him more, why not?
He's still walking, so we can still kick him, right?
But it sounds good, we can help him, Adam, buy his first apartment.
Well, I guess everyone would do that, father, parents, guardian.
You're right, it sounds good, but I can share here with you and the viewers a certain maxim,
which I did not invent to make it clear, but I really liked it.
What is good for politicians is bad for the economy, and what is good for the economy is bad for politicians.
And what is good for people?
What is good for the economy, so it's bad for politicians.
A healthy economy is good for people, right?
But very bad for politicians, for great, powerful people, companies, entities.
For them it is the greatest tragedy.
For normal people it is the greatest happiness.
These are the facts.
We're taking a break here, but we'll be back to the subject in a moment.
Please do not leave the radio receivers.

Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the FED.
I'm Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier, president of the FED.
Today we're talking about the situation on the housing market.
It reminds me of the saying ""In a murky water it's best to fish"",
and the more regulations and regulations, the more murky the water is.
Undoubtedly, yes.
And who can afford super lawyers, advisors and specialists?
An ordinary Kowalski who wants to buy the only apartment in his life?
No way.
A gigantic corporation that buys hundreds and thousands of such apartments.
The whole estate.
They can afford it. They will have the best tax relief, the best relief, the best evasion of fines.
Because they can afford it.
Not only that, they can even afford the so-called ""lobbying"",
which is, to put it bluntly, bribery of the rulers.
Because they come in with billions, so for them giving 10 million in cash is a fraction of what they will earn on it.
No one is able to influence politicians, rulers, officials.
No one normal is able to.
But the giants are.
That's why the regulations are for them.
As you said.
And there is one more element in all of this.
Credit is sometimes taken for 20-30 years.
It requires some faith in the future, that everything will be fine, that I will be able to pay off this loan, that I will earn.
Does not taking these loans mean that the moods have fallen and we have lost this faith in the future?
As I said, it's not that we have lost faith in the future.
People would take it, because people are not too smart, unfortunately, they do not learn.
But, that banks do not want to give anymore.
That's all.
If banks would suddenly say ""Ok, we give you super preferential loans"", the queue would stand.
It's obvious.
So people are not smarter at all, it's not that something has improved.
No, those who were not sensible and did not have economic knowledge, are still not sensible and do not have economic knowledge.
That's all.
Like an alcoholic who suddenly cannot buy a bottle of vodka, is he suddenly smarter because he does not drink?
No, he does not drink because he was not sold vodka and he does not have money for it.
That's it. Simple.
He would still be willing to buy.
Do you understand?
This is such an example.
And this is why this audition is, among other things, to have more wisdom in society and to make smarter decisions.
Thank you very much for today's conversation and I invite you next week.
Thank you.
I was Maciej Stefaniak, economist, financial expert, the ""Foundation for more wisdom"" and the conversation was led by Krzysztof Strauchman.

### Key Themes:
1. **Economic Regulation**: The text discusses the use of indicators such as minimum wage and maximum price, which suggest regulatory measures in the economy.
2. **Market Dysfunctionality**: There is a concern that healthy market rules are not functioning properly, indicating issues with the free market economy.
3. **Energy Prices**: The conversation highlights the absurdity of current energy prices and their disconnect from economic reality.
4. **Political Decisions and Sanctions**: The text critically evaluates political decisions and sanctions against Russia, questioning their effectiveness and impact on the economy.
5. **Socio-Economic Impact**: There is a focus on the socio-economic consequences of these policies, including bankruptcies, job losses, and the struggle of ordinary citizens to afford basic necessities like coal.

### Impacts:
1. **Economic Dimension**: The imposition of regulations and sanctions has led to economic instability, with soaring energy prices and mass company bankruptcies.
2. **Technological Dimension**: No direct technological impacts are discussed, but indirectly, the energy crisis may impact technological sectors dependent on affordable energy.
3. **Political Dimension**: Political decisions regarding sanctions and energy policies are being criticized for their lack of effectiveness and for causing economic hardship.
4. **Social Dimension**: Ordinary citizens are facing severe financial strain due to the high cost of living, with significant impacts on employment and quality of life.

### Examples and Evidence:
- **Regulations**: The mention of minimum wage and maximum price regulations indicates attempts at controlling prices.
- **Energy Prices**: The specific example of coal prices increasing tenfold demonstrates the economic burden on citizens.
- **Sanctions**: Criticism focuses on financial sanctions not working as intended, with transactions still happening through unsanctioned banks and countries like China.
- **Socio-Economic Impact**: Real-world examples include a cleaning lady unable to afford coal despite years of honest work, reflecting the broader socio-economic distress.

### Opportunities and Risks:
1. **Opportunities**:
   - There is an opportunity for economic reforms that could lead to more effective policies and better market regulation.
2. **Risks**:
   - High energy prices may continue to strain the economy, leading to further bankruptcies and job losses.
   - Ineffective political decisions could exacerbate social unrest and economic inequality.
   - The continued closure of coal mines risks long-term energy security.

### Conclusion:
The conversation reveals a critical assessment of current economic policies, highlighting the need for more effective market regulation and political decision-making. It underscores the real-world impacts on ordinary citizens and calls for a reevaluation of strategies to mitigate the economic crisis.

What's the news, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear again?
I found the data of the main statistical office, which concern the end of the last year.
It turns out that Poles are increasingly suspending their companies and are not in a hurry to open new ones, at least not at the pace as before.
This is how it is with the market economy, that someone will succeed, someone will fall, someone will fail.
Is the current scale of this phenomenon different from what has been happening in Poland so far?
Can it indicate something bad in our economy?
I think so.
Almost every third entrepreneur thinks about closing the company, and every second one would look for a job at the stage.
We read in the studies of the ESA Business from 2002.
Maybe I'll give a few facts.
Poles are leaders in entrepreneurship on a global scale.
For example, 78% of Poles believe that running your own business is a good idea.
This is the second highest result among 21 countries studied in Europe and the tenth among 50 countries in the world.
So we respect businessmen.
We are entrepreneurs.
Amazingly, and on a global scale.
Not only that, we like entrepreneurs.
77% of Poles believe that people who run a business and are successful should be recognized.
This is the sixth highest result in Europe.
So there is a will, there is respect, but unfortunately all these positives destroy the media.
You don't mean the Gazeta Telewizji?
I mean all of this.
In 2016, 58% wrote positively, and in 2019, after three years, only 37%.
It's a drop by half.
These are the studies from CBOS.
This shows what's going on.
Poles are an incredibly entrepreneurial nation.
We respect entrepreneurs, but the sudden external factors are disturbing us.
But you're not suggesting that the media are running a campaign that is aimed at entrepreneurship.
No, I have no evidence for that.
I'm talking about facts, not speculations or assumptions.
I'm talking about facts.
These are the facts.
But a Polish entrepreneur is strong enough not to care about media reports and just does his own thing.
I'm convinced of that.
That's right, but again, more data.
In 2019, only 6% of Poles wanted to start a company in the next three years, so until 2022.
And this is a result half lower than the average European.
So suddenly, from the leader, we fall into people who don't want to start a business.
Not that they don't want to.
So we're much worse off than the average in Europe.
This must show some disturbing trends.
Because I have some great, positive data.
For example, Poles outnumber the average European in the number of existing, already mature businesses.
So about 13% to 8% in Europe.
So almost twice as much.
But again, in all other aspects, young, new and established businesses, we fall below the average European again.
These are really disturbing data.
For the last 9 years, the index of young companies has decreased from 9% to 5.4% in Poland.
While the index of mature companies has increased from 5% to 12.8%.
I suspect that it's the income that decides.
Mature companies have a good situation and earn well, while young ones, unfortunately, have a hard time.
That's why no one wants to start them.
But why in Europe and other countries it's not like that?
Maybe they use more support from the surrounding, generally the state.
I suspect that it's exactly as you said.
Because, as far as I remember, Poland is in second place in Europe and 10th in the world among the countries with the most complex business rules.
So it's the Global Business Complexity Index 2021.
So we are in the lead, where it's the most difficult to run a business.
And we're talking about 10th place in the world, 2nd in Europe.
So we're at the very bottom when it comes to conditions.
Which, as you rightly noticed, may lead to the fact that we want less and less.
In addition, as we said, the media do not encourage the introduction, do not build a positive image of a businessman.
The same is confirmed by the so-called National Index of Entrepreneurship Conditions, where we are at the very end.
15th place out of 22.
Well, that's not encouraging.
Funny.
Do you know who is in first place?
Romania? Bulgaria?
No, Switzerland.
Because it's the best there.
That's why rich countries have much higher indicators, so it's better to run a business there.
Where it's bad to run a business, unfortunately, the indicators will be low.
I will only add that Poland got the same points as Belarus.
And it's better to leave it without comment.
And, above all, there are also modern or current two years of difficulties related to energy increases.
But we'll come back to this topic after the break.

What's up, Mr. Mariusz? We're talking with Mariusz Stefaniak,
the president of the ""More Wisdom"" Foundation, an economist and a financial expert.
Today, we're talking about small businesses.
Mr. Mariusz, the logic indicates that countries with a lot of income,
countries that make a lot of money, should create the best, the easiest conditions for small business development.
Taking into account that small and medium-sized businesses are a very important part of our national product.
Why is it not so? Why is it easier to run a business in a rich Switzerland?
You've brought up a great topic.
The answer is simple.
The Swiss like Swiss companies and the Swiss government promotes Swiss companies.
In Poland, the government and regulations hate Polish companies, Poles running companies.
I'll give you a simple example.
The tax on CIT is only 0.004% of the company's income, which is less than 0.5%, not 19% as the Polish companies pay.
What kind of business will fall at higher costs in a smaller market, with fewer customers, etc.?
It's obvious.
Instead of paying 1.8 million CIT taxes, Osho should pay 510 million taxes.
If you list all the years of activity, and count the dozens of such huge businesses,
it turns out that Poland would be mega-rich, not mega-involved.
On the other hand, Mr. Mariusz, I also came across some data,
which shows that in 2021, public assistance provided to various companies,
including Polish TV, amounted to PLN 76 billion.
That's over 10% of our annual budget.
Among other things, 300,000 small companies benefited from this assistance.
It was mainly about various Covid shields.
So what? On the one hand, we prefer big companies, and we give money to small ones.
This is some kind of double-crossing.
Let's ask where this assistance comes from.
Do you know that you have been working for half of your life for Danina?
And as an economist, I don't want you to give me anything,
just stop taking it from me.
Then people who are smart and hard-working will live well,
and not stupid and lazy.
Let's promote those who know how to do something,
not those who don't know how to do something.
But we live in a time when there are more and more state regulations,
and society simply demands them.
Yes, because politically it is well seen,
but economically it is not necessary.
Speaking of assistance, I can give examples that I know.
Orange, according to the ZPP analysis,
in 2015-2019, for every zloty of the tax paid,
received almost 10 zlotys of public assistance.
Orange, sir, is a French company.
And it's gigantic.
That's why I say that all foreign companies are economically harmful
for the Polish economy for a long time,
but beneficial for Polish politicians.
And one day I can justify it.
But we are in the European Union, we cannot eliminate someone
because he is a foreign capital.
In the European Union, equality of rules applies.
I'm not talking about eliminating.
I'm just saying not to promote,
not to finance,
not to give incredible benefits.
Why do foreign companies have tax benefits,
as I have given, for example?
They practically do not pay any taxes.
I can give examples that this is a joke or a joke for us,
for Polish entrepreneurs.
They get public assistance from the Polish budget.
And how much did you get in your life from this public assistance?
I managed various companies and believe me,
I never got any public assistance from any company.
For decades of running, even large companies, small companies.
In my opinion, you should all create equal rules of action
and equal support or just its lack.
Let everyone deal with the market alone.
It would be fair if there were no special preferences,
tax relief, financing and so on for foreign companies,
which I claim are harmful to us.
And besides, it means that you can't compete with foreign companies,
markets, entities.
You simply have no chance.
You have no chance of competing with them.
And such an Orange or Sean will always crush Polish competitors,
because they get an incredible bonus, sir.
Well, they start from a much higher trap,
because they are big, strong companies that enter the market.
No, please forgive me, but again,
I personally, professionally, came across powerful Polish companies
that were destroyed, such as Optimus, SA, sir,
which was the largest European IT company.
Such a Polish Microsoft.
And you know what happened?
The rules were imposed on him,
and ultimately, the owner of Optimus won.
They turned out to be illegal, that's right.
Yes, yes, of course.
Mr. Roman Kluska, who now seems to be a sheep and has enough business.
Well, you know, that's how it ends for Polish companies that were successful.
Look at the business of Mr. no longer alive Gołębiowski.
A gigantic entrepreneur with great success and so on.
He is dead, he did not survive what was done to him.
The police physically murdered him.
I can say that, boldly.
So, you know, there are many examples.
One more break, we'll be back in a moment
with the topic of regulation on the energy market for entrepreneurs.

What is played, Mr. Mariusz, part 3.
Our interlocutor is Mariusz Stefaniak, financial economist.
We are talking about the situation of small companies.
For a year, a very serious problem for small companies are energy prices.
Coal prices, electricity prices have increased many times.
Many businesses are closing for this reason.
He just can't survive it.
We were talking about the fact that there should be clear, clear rules on the market.
But should the energy market be regulated by the state in this case?
Or should it be left in the invisible hand of the free market?
Interesting question, because there is no clear answer to it.
First of all, the energy market is one of the strategic sectors for the state.
So it can be one of the factors that threaten the sovereignty of a given state.
So I can't imagine it not being controlled by the state in any way.
Because it is too neurological part.
Secondly, if we leave it in the hands of, let's be honest, politicians,
I don't see it either.
So I'll put it this way, it would be best if it was regulated by healthy free market rules,
but with supervision that controls the security of the state.
That's how I would put it.
And we are dealing with such control.
The state has introduced regulations on the maximum prices for people, for municipalities, for self-governments,
for so-called sensitive entities.
Should these prices be regulated also in the enterprise sector?
Or should the business simply buy at the market price?
I don't agree with these regulated prices at all.
Because that's where the evil is, in my opinion.
If you see any economic indicator, minimum wage, maximum price,
you know that something is wrong with this economy.
Because it means that healthy market rules don't work there at all.
If you look at the free market economy, if it was American, it was, because it is not anymore,
they didn't have such regulations.
You practically had free market everywhere.
There was a low fuel price there, yes, but it wasn't, as we say here,
that some maximum for some group.
No, no, no, no, the state just didn't make money on this fuel in general,
because it's great for the economy.
Low fuel prices, low energy prices, it's great.
These prices are absurd, sir.
They have nothing to do with the economic reality.
Well, yes, now they were very high.
It is known that the government earns on fuel, on excise, on cotton wool,
from which it was withdrawing from time to time.
Well, Mr. Mariusz, but it was and it is.
The war caused in Ukraine that these prices were skyrocketing in an unimaginable way.
Well, I would definitely not agree with that.
No war caused it.
This is a fact and that's it.
It's hard to even discuss it.
Suddenly we were short of 10 million tons of coal that we imported from Russia,
and which we decided not to import.
Suddenly we were offended by the supply of coal from Russia.
I mean, we used it and we're just getting out of it now.
Well, a lot has changed on this world market.
You're right.
The things I've mentioned are true, but your interpretation is not true.
Well, I'm listening.
So we stop importing, we stop receiving energy fuel on such a scale.
But this is our own decision, not related to any war.
So it didn't go up because of the war,
but because of the decisions of specific people, political decisions.
Because we are not in a state of war with Russia, as you may not know.
So I don't see any contradictions sent to the point of not keeping in touch with them.
We are at the stage of economic restrictions in relation to Russia.
But these are political decisions, sir.
Not only that, these are decisions of hypocrites.
On the one hand, sanctions are being mentioned against Russia,
and on the other hand, these sanctions are not working.
Never in any aspect.
Financial sanctions, sir, I say this as an economist,
are a concrete nonsense, it's a fake, a media fake.
Because I know at least a few Russian banks that function normally.
So we disliked a few banks, so that it looked good in the newspapers,
but those banks that are ""under sanctions""
are pushing their stuff through those that are not under sanctions.
And all the billion-dollar transactions Russia is pushing through,
just check what I'm saying, through Chinese banks.
Where are these sanctions?
Same with fuel, same with coal.
Now, just so you know, there are gigantic purchases of Putin's coal
through many countries, sir.
Do you think that what they will do with this coal?
That the miners will put it together? They will sell it to us at high prices.
But the Poles are really paying for this media hype, sir.
For these fictional pseudo-sanctions.
Right now, because of our political decisions,
the bankruptcy of companies,
massive bankruptcies of Polish companies, sir.
In a moment, when you get the data, you will say,
""Oh, it's bad."" No, it's not bad.
It's tragic, sir.
And now I also have such data,
that in some shops, half of the turnover is falling, sir.
Half! Not 10%, not 20%. 50%!
Why don't people have money, sir?
I had a case with a lady,
who worked at a cleaning company.
I talked to her for a moment.
And she said, ""Sir, I've just put on gas,
even though I know it's expensive,
that it costs money, etc.
But when they tell me that I have to pay 20,000 for coal for the heating season,
I don't have that money!""
Do you understand? I'm talking to a normal person.
This lady has been working honestly for years,
and she can't afford to buy coal.
In a country that is a potentate of coal.
It's a nightmare.
And now, we've closed most of our coal mines, sir.
And now, again, we don't want to buy coal from bad Russians, really.
What are we supposed to do? Die of hunger? Cold?
What do we gain from this, sir? That we're offended by Putin?
I understand that we can be offended by Putin,
when we have our own coal mines,
and then, okay, we don't buy anything,
we increase the production in our mines three times.
But we don't have anything to increase, because we don't have a mine!
Because we've just closed them!
And do you know how much a ton of coal from a Polish mine cost?
Before the crisis? A year ago or two years ago?
Well, within the limits of 300-400 zlotys.
Now, 3000.
No! 200-250.
Well, a tenfold difference, anyway.
I understand, sir, we pay 10 times more.
Why? Let him tell me what the reason is, because I don't know the reason.
Mr. Mariusz, it's time to finish our broadcast,
but we're already cutting to the next topic,
to the next episode,
what's happening with Polish coal,
what's happening with coal in general.
Thank you very much for today's conversation.
Our guest was Mariusz Stefaniak,

C:/Users/G/Documents/GitHub/audycje.com.pl/content/audio\CJG_06_2023_02_18.mp3,"**Key Themes:**

1. **Economic Development**: The text discusses the factors that contribute to economic development, with a focus on cheap energy as a key element.
2. **Environmental Pollution**: It highlights concerns about air pollution caused by fossil fuels and illegal waste imports from Europe.
3. **Health Impacts**: The health consequences of high concentrations of suspended dust are emphasized, including an estimated 50,000 deaths per year in Poland.
4. **Economic Policy and Decision-Making**: It critiques the ideological and moral reasons behind Poland's energy policies and their impact on the economy.

**Impacts:**

- **Economic**: The shift towards more expensive energy sources threatens economic stability, potentially leading to business collapses and increased poverty levels.
- **Technological**: High costs of energy may hinder technological advancements that rely on affordable power.
- **Political**: Decisions regarding energy policy can strain international relations, as seen in the critique of Poland's inconsistent stance with China.
- **Social**: Increased air pollution leads to significant health issues, exacerbating existing social problems and potentially causing mass suicides due to economic stress.

**Examples and Evidence:**

- The text mentions that around 50,000 people in Poland die each year from diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust.
- It notes that China is the world's largest polluter but continues to have significant business ties with Poland.
- The shift from PLN 300 to PLN 2,000 for coal illustrates the rapid increase in energy costs and its potential economic repercussions.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

- **Opportunities**: Investing in cleaner energy sources could mitigate health risks and improve environmental conditions while stabilizing the economy.
- **Risks**: Rapid increases in energy costs can lead to economic collapse, increased poverty, and social unrest, exacerbating existing health problems.

**Conclusion:**

The text underscores the urgent need for a balanced approach to economic development that considers both environmental and health impacts. The shift towards expensive energy sources poses significant risks, including economic instability and public health crises. Future considerations should focus on more consistent policies regarding international business ties and investments in cleaner energy solutions to mitigate these risks.","['airpollution', 'Pollution', 'coal', 'poland', 'coal', 'coal', 'Coal', 'communistChina', 'China', 'market', 'pandemic', 'Poland', 'Coal', 'depression', 'Russia', 'Coal', 'Sanctions', 'Sanctions', 'Ukraine', 'drama', 'coal', 'Putin', 'Ukraine', 'pollution', 'environment', 'Coal', 'economy', 'Death', 'Economy', 'genocide', 'Geopolitics', 'Poverty', 'resources', 'EnergyCrisis', 'war', 'Sanctions', 'Treaty', 'Economics', 'violence', 'Crisis', 'china', 'Ukraine', 'Energy', 'garbage', 'Economy', 'economics', 'Energy', 'Economy', 'aggression', 'advertising""', 'Market', 'Economy', 'Economics', 'Suicide""', '""Crisis', 'Energy', 'Trade', 'Economy', 'Inflation', 'Annexation', 'Aggression', 'Economy', 'Market', 'politics', 'Future', 'War', '""abandonment', 'resources', 'money', 'health', 'energy', 'energy', 'Energy', 'energy', 'Crisis', 'Weapons', 'politics', 'Russia', 'health', 'Sanctions', 'Money', 'Business', 'energy', 'Commitments', 'Politics', 'appearances', 'Market', 'EU', 'Idiocracy']","﻿1

What's up, Mr. Mariusz?
What did you hear there again?
What's up, Mr. Mariusz? Our guest is Mariusz Stefaniak,
financial expert, economist,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
We're talking about coal.
A year ago, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began,
coal for such an average consumer in Poland
cost around 350 zlotys per ton.
Now it costs 2,000 zlotys.
And with government support,
guarantees, subsidies,
even up to 3,500 zlotys in total,
so it was ten times higher than a year ago.
Have the costs of mining increased so much?
No, of course not.
In fact, they haven't increased at all.
Well, probably a few people got a raise,
energy costs have increased a bit.
Well, probably, but not a thousand percent.
Well, definitely not. It's obvious.
The problem is somewhere else.
But in response to the war, coal was also expensive in world stocks.
We ourselves import it, because we stopped importing coal from Russia
as the first in response to the war, as part of the sanctions.
Maybe this is the objective reason that coal is more expensive.
I don't think so.
Because Russia was our largest coal supplier,
and it was many times higher than any other contractor.
This is an absolutely obvious fact.
In addition, Russian coal was of very good quality.
It was better and cheaper, in short,
than, we are talking about opium coal, which was imported.
And what we are importing now is many times more expensive,
as you correctly indicated,
and unfortunately many times worse.
So we are importing worse and more expensive.
In the name of what?
Well, in the name of some solidarity with Ukraine,
in the name of ethics, in politics,
we just want to force Russia to stop its aggression against Ukraine with sanctions.
I completely disagree with that.
Someone who talks about ethics and at the same time does business with communist China,
which is one of the worst regimes in the world rankings,
with the largest documented level of genocide.
And there is no problem with that? Really?
Well, but China is not attacking neighboring countries yet.
They are attacking, of course they are attacking.
You just have to pay attention to the news.
For example, non-stop for many, many years there have been armed conflicts with mortals,
for example, on the border with India.
Anyway, there was such an incident recently.
Literally dozens of soldiers on both sides were fighting,
without firearms, because they have such a treaty from a certain time,
that they can fight without using modern weapons.
It sounds a bit funny, but these are the facts.
In addition, China has really been aggressive towards neighboring countries.
Military aggression, of course, is not mentioned.
I don't know why, maybe business is more important than morality.
Another thing.
Now China is openly announcing the annexation of Taiwan,
an independent country that does not want to be joined at all.
And China openly declares it and no one has the slightest problem with it.
And with this country we are developing contacts.
Moreover, we are talking about coal, and I am also talking about coal.
We import coal from China, as well as fuel.
And please note that if we stop buying all energy components from Russia,
we will actually keep buying them.
For example, from China.
Because China and Russia are one of the biggest partners.
They even signed such an agreement on unconditional friendly relations.
They are such friends to kill.
And there is a gigantic, there are special transit lines with large passages,
where, for example, Russian coal is compressed.
And Ivan, that's why this moral aspect does not speak to me at all.
Not at all.
But in that case, we should not react to war right outside our borders.
China is far away.
I don't want to justify the policy of tolerance towards China,
but China is far away, and Russia is close.
We are another country that can become an object of aggression.
Should we just keep our trade contacts with Russia and pretend that nothing is happening?
We will come back to you after the break, continuing this topic of conversation.

What is going on, Mr. Mariusz?
I am Mariusz Stefaniak, a financial and economic expert,
president of the ""Więcej Mądrości"" foundation.
We are talking about coal and the international coal-mined policy.
Mr. Mariusz, what should we do?
Should we close our eyes, continue our trade contacts with Russia
and pretend that nothing is happening in Ukraine?
No, we don't have to pretend that nothing is happening.
I mean that as an economist, as a manager, I know that violent actions usually cause violent losses.
Everything can be done, but in a planned and thought-out way.
Because if someone says that suddenly the whole country can cut off, for example,
20 million tons of coal that we have brought from Russia, just like that,
then I turn my head with disbelief.
I say, it can't end well.
Because on the one hand, we are not able to fight Russia.
In fact, we are still maintaining full diplomatic contacts.
So no European country, none of our partners has declared war.
Everyone is still maintaining diplomatic contacts.
This is number one.
Moreover, everyone is trading with Russia.
And despite the loud announcements, this trade is still going on.
And even as I checked recently,
at this moment, countries are making gigantic reserves
by buying a lot of different ingredients from Russia, including coal, coal, gas.
So in a moment, we will buy the same Russian coal, but at a tenfold higher price.
Is this wise? Is this good for Poland?
But let's start with why Poland, being a power when it comes to coal,
imports coal from Russia.
Is it cheaper? Is it better?
Didn't we defend our mining market?
The answer to this is in the word ""coal"".
People don't understand that the word ""coal"" is a key word that opens many doors.
Firstly, we have two types of coal, stone and bronze.
But in fact, there are two stages of the transformation of the same organic substance, which is the ore.
Secondly, according to the Polish norm, we have 11 types of coal,
which are additionally divided depending on their use.
Energy, coke, special, including anthracite.
So what kind of coal are we talking about?
You see, because each of them has completely different parameters,
which, as I said, are very precisely defined in the Polish norm.
Because of this, they have a completely different assessment,
a completely different price and different mining conditions and mining depth, mining costs, cleaning costs.
Therefore, it is impossible to answer unambiguously.
As an engineer, I had practical classes here in the university,
related to the cast iron, furnaces, metal processing.
And one of my lecturers was the author of scientific papers on coal.
So it gave me some basis for economic analysis of this industry.
So here I immediately warn the listeners.
The use of the word ""coal"" is only such a misleading, substitutive word,
which does not show any problem at all.
But we also have different types of coal at home.
We have both brown coal and stone coal.
We are rich in coal.
Yes, it's true.
Although, for example, anthracite, which is the most valuable, the most valuable,
of all types of coal, has already been officially defined.
It was officially stated that it ceased to exist in Poland.
It was completely exploited.
For decades, the policy in the mines was, let's face it, very low level.
And it is still at a low level.
The management of Polish coal, let's face it, was terrible.
From an economic, managerial point of view.
It's just a bottomless pit.
So this Polish gold, as it is called,
is now in such a state that we got rid of the world's best quality,
practically the best quality of raw material.
Now we have different types of coal, as I said.
At the same time, the most valuable are deeply located.
Therefore, there are high costs, technically difficult to extract.
Now we have a lot of easily extractable coal,
but relatively low quality,
which, of course, also has a lot of applications and is very valuable.
So it's not like it's worth nothing.
It is worth it, but it is no longer what it was.
Not in such a low extraction costs as it was.
Generally speaking, yes, Putin's coal is better and cheaper.
That's how you could say it briefly for the listener.
What will correspond to what I said before.
Now we are bringing coal, which is actually Brea,
compared to what we took from Russia.
It is 10 times more expensive, several times worse energetically.
Because there are components that I will not bore you with,
although energy, although the content of sulfur, the content of ashes.
At this point, we just made a great show.
Basically, we will prove ourselves for this war in Ukraine,
paying horribly for it and taking something of super low quality.
And moreover, the most important thing in all this,
we still keep it official that we will close all our mines until 2049.
So we will be 100% accused of buying.
And now the question is, from whom? For how much?
And here we will put a dot, but we will come back to this interesting thread in a moment.

What is played, Mr. Mariusz?
Once again on the radio, Mariusz Stefaniak, financial expert.
Mr. Mariusz, in this case, Polish mines should now catch the wind in the sails.
Since they produced for 350 zlotys, and now they can sell several times more expensively.
For anyone who does business, this is a perfect opportunity to develop their wings.
And not so.
Because Polish mines have been closed for years.
Let's be honest, Polish mining industry structures are in a planned disappearance.
Literally.
This is how it should be and these are the plans of our rulers.
So this Hossa that took over is not something to be happy about.
Because we have nothing to be happy about.
We can only look into the future, in a few years, where we will close more mines.
We will close all mines completely and ask ourselves the question, what then?
Then we will have cheap energy behind you.
I don't think it looks like that.
Let's look at the countries that introduced it and what is happening to them after 10 years.
Mr. Mariusz, indeed, EU commitments, commitments resulting from emission restrictions,
cause that in a dozen or twenty, thirty years we will have to leave coal.
Anyway, there are reasons for this, and these are very serious, even health reasons.
Coal has a bad impact on people.
But should we completely give up coal, as it is predicted in our strategic documents?
From the point of view of the economy, absolutely not.
It is an idiotic move, it is a suicidal move in my opinion.
Because if you look at the alternatives, all of them are definitely worse, more dangerous and more harmful.
Giving up coal is not a wise thing.
Giving up fossil fuels is not a wise thing.
This is how I see it.
Okay, but we are in a situation where we are strategically obliged to eliminate coal and its combustion within 20-30 years.
And at the same time, suddenly this coal turned out to be necessary for us and we have to bring it down.
How to reconcile this?
It will be reconciled in such a way that we will fall into a gigantic economic crisis that will completely ruin our economy.
For me it is absolutely obvious and inevitable.
I omit all other aspects that cause the collapse of the Polish economy,
but the next energy factor is definitely added here.
We cut our legs in so many ways and so violently,
this is what scares me the most.
That there are such violent movements, which, you know, when you already have a sick person and you still kick him on the knees, breaking his knees,
he will not go far.
He boasted himself that he was turning me over.
This is how I see the Polish economy.
Why? Who does it and why is it doing it?
Why is the strong Polish economy seen badly?
Who is seen badly?
I think that if I look at the richest countries in the world, sir,
they are the richest and you know what?
Just about these bad, ugly fossil fuels,
which we want to consistently extort from our economic system.
Well, cheap energy is one of the important elements of economic development.
Cheap energy.
Of course yes.
And we do everything to make this energy as expensive as possible and even better from abroad.
We have no control over it at all, so if someone comes to us and says ""pay us 3000, not 300 zlotys""
and Poland will have to pay.
Now we don't have to, but we do it on our own, and that scares me, I'll be honest.
Because we don't have to do it.
I understand ideological, moral reasons and so on,
but if we wanted to act morally, we would be more consistent and we would cut off China many, many years ago.
Okay, so stop murdering people, lock yourself up in camps,
scare other countries with aggression or even attack other countries,
do all kinds of other terrible things,
then we'll go back to business.
Mr. Mariusz, but there are also health issues that cannot be underestimated.
I read estimates that in Poland, due to diseases caused by high concentration of suspended dust,
even 50,000 people die every year.
This is a fact.
Everyone who goes to the city center in the middle of winter, especially a small town,
and feels the air, feels the stench at the same time, which is caused by low emissions.
How to deal with the behavior of fossil fuels?
You know what? I also have other data.
And my data says so, sir.
A very large number of air pollution can also be related to a gigantic scourge,
which is systematically hidden and swept under the carpet,
that is, that Poland is a ""trashcan"" of Europe.
They bring us, of course illegally, but in a gigantic amount of garbage,
which are, for example, burned.
And they cause incredible air pollution,
toxic substances in the air, and we are talking about really gigantic amounts.
And this is a procedure that has been going on for many, many years.
And someone also makes gigantic money on it.
Please believe me.
And why does it last?
And why is this pollution not bad, and the pollution of coal, which is all over the world, is bad?
Please pay attention to the world statistics.
Who is the biggest pollutant in the world, sir?
There is only one answer.
China.
If you liquidate all the other countries that poison the world,
it will practically have no meaning.
China and the USA are responsible for about 90% of all pollution.
But we have great business systems with them, sir.
We develop them.
But we only destroy the economy in ourselves.
As they say, we will be sacrificed to the Pope, sir.
And because of this, our children will be starving, our companies will collapse,
and our economy will be on its knees.
Well, Mr. Mariusz, we do not yet have such a situation that children in Poland die of starvation.
And you want it to be?
Well, we are on a great path.
No, I absolutely do not want it.
I do not want it and I hope it will not be so.
But, sir, coal from PLN 300 jumps to PLN 2,000.
You do not have to be a genius and not an economist, sir, to understand what this leads to.
Do you know how many children are starved in Poland?
Today, now, as you say, they do not die.
Yes, they do not die, but there are a terrifying number of starved.
And what will happen when these effects actually multiply with a snowball?
Because now, yes, we are talking about a very bad situation, but this is just one of the symptoms.
And this is not science fiction, this is not something that will be, I do not know, for a hundred years or maybe not, no, no, no, no.
We are so close to a powerful crisis that can really lead to the death of many people.
Death by suicide, because bankruptcy leads to what?
To mass suicides, because people are not able to withstand this stress, lack of hope.
Today, now, it is already being said about the pandemic, sir, depression.
There is a drama, just.
Please check this thread, it is terrifying, and for some reason it is not on the front pages of newspapers.
And it looks terrifying, that's all I can say.
We will return to all these matters in the next edition of our hearing.
We are already inviting you together next week, next Saturday at 10.30 and Sunday at 10.30, what is played.
Mr. Mariusz, our guest is Mariusz Stefania, President of the Foundation ""More Wisdom"".
Thank you, goodbye.
See you.
