**Key Themes:**

1. The Polish real estate market is experiencing a decline in housing loan applications and prices.
2. The sudden influx of Ukrainian refugees has led to an abnormal situation in the market.
3. The government and authorities are starting to take notice of the unhealthy market system.

**Impacts:**

Economic:
- Decline in housing prices and loan applications due to banks' reluctance to provide financing.
- Potential for further economic instability if the situation is not addressed.

Technological:
- The impact of inflation on the economy, with interest rates rising as a result.

Political:
- Government intervention, such as imposing additional fees on companies buying flats in bulk, aiming to regulate the market and protect local buyers.

Social:
- The strain on the housing market due to the influx of refugees from Ukraine, leading to increased demand for housing.

**Examples and Evidence:**

* The data from the Office of Credit Information showing a significant decline in housing loan applications (30% decrease).
* The report by Expandera and Rentier.io indicating that rent rates have fallen after 10 months of continuous increases.
* Mariusz Stefaniak's prediction about the crisis in the housing market and his analysis of the situation.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

Opportunities:
- The government's efforts to regulate the market and protect local buyers through additional fees on companies buying flats in bulk.

Risks:
- Potential for further economic instability if the situation is not addressed.
- The strain on the housing market due to the influx of refugees from Ukraine, leading to increased demand for housing.

**Conclusion:**

The Polish real estate market is facing significant challenges due to the decline in housing loan applications and prices. The government's intervention aims to regulate the market and protect local buyers. However, the situation remains unhealthy, and further economic instability or strain on the market cannot be ruled out if not addressed. It is essential for policymakers to consider the long-term implications of their actions and work towards finding sustainable solutions to address the root causes of the problem.
