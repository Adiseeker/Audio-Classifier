2. **Technological Dimension**: The text does not explicitly mention technological advancements but implies that modern market mechanisms should adjust to changing global conditions.
3. **Political Dimension**: The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of sanctions against Russia, questioning their impact on the domestic economy.
4. **Social Dimension**: There is a clear emphasis on how economic policies are impacting the daily lives of ordinary citizens, particularly those in lower-income brackets.

### Conclusion
