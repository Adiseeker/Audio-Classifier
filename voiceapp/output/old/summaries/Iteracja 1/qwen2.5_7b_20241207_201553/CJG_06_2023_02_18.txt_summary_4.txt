The text discusses the Polish economy's challenges, focusing on the economic impacts of high energy costs, health issues related to air pollution, and environmental concerns linked to waste disposal practices.

### Impacts

- **Economic**: The text highlights the negative impact of escalating energy prices, which could potentially lead to increased poverty, particularly among children. Higher energy costs are seen as a significant threat to economic stability.
- **Technological**: There is an implicit critique of outdated and polluting technologies that contribute to higher energy costs and environmental degradation.
- **Political**: The discussion touches on ideological motivations behind certain policies, such as the push for expensive renewable energy solutions, which may be driven more by political ideology than practical economics.
- **Social**: Health issues, including respiratory diseases caused by air pollution, are a critical social concern. Additionally, economic hardships could lead to increased stress and mental health issues.

### Examples and Evidence

- The text provides real-world data on the number of deaths annually due to poor air quality in Poland (50,000 people).
- It mentions the illegal disposal of large amounts of garbage, particularly related to burning processes that significantly contribute to air pollution.
- The comparison between Poland's energy costs and those of other countries underscores the financial burden faced by Polish consumers.

### Opportunities and Risks

**Risks:**
- The current path of high energy prices and poor environmental practices could exacerbate social inequalities and lead to widespread economic hardship.
- Failure to address these issues could result in political instability and public unrest.

### Conclusion

The text underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to address both the immediate health impacts of pollution and the long-term economic sustainability of Poland. It suggests that prioritizing affordable energy sources, strict enforcement of environmental regulations, and promoting sustainable development are crucial steps forward. Future considerations should include policy measures that balance economic growth with environmental protection and public health, ensuring that all segments of society benefit from these efforts.

Action points might include:
- Implementing stricter controls on waste disposal practices to reduce air pollution.
- Subsidizing or providing incentives for energy-efficient technologies and renewable sources.
- Increasing public awareness about the health impacts of poor air quality through educational campaigns.
