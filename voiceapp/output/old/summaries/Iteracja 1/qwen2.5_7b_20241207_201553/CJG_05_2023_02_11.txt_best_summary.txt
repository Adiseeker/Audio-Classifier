### Key Themes

The main themes in this text revolve around the current state and trends of entrepreneurship and small business development in Poland, comparing it to other countries, particularly Switzerland. The discussion centers on entrepreneurial attitudes, media influence, government regulations, and economic conditions affecting business creation and survival.

### Impacts

1. **Economic**: The data indicates a decline in new business startups and an increase in the closure of existing businesses. This trend could lead to reduced job opportunities and a slower pace of economic growth.
2. **Technological**: While not explicitly discussed, the ease or difficulty of running a business can impact technological adoption and innovation. Favorable conditions for businesses often drive investment in technology.
3. **Political**: Government policies and regulations significantly influence entrepreneurial activities. The perception that the government is more inclined to support foreign companies over local ones could deter entrepreneurs from starting businesses.
4. **Social**: Media reports have shown a decline in positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship, which can affect public perception and subsequent behavior.

### Examples and Evidence

- **Entrepreneurial Attitudes**: Poles are generally entrepreneurial; 78% believe running their own business is a good idea, ranking second among 21 European countries.
- **Media Influence**: The percentage of positive media reports about entrepreneurship has dropped significantly, from 58% in 2016 to only 37% in 2019.
- **Regulatory Environment**: Poland ranks second in Europe and 10th globally for the complexity of business rules. The Global Business Complexity Index 2021 places Poland near the bottom when it comes to ease of doing business.
- **Business Statistics**: The percentage of young companies has decreased from 9% to 5.4% over nine years, while mature companies have increased from 5% to 12.8%.

### Opportunities and Risks

**Opportunities:**

- Streamlining business regulations and processes.

**Risks:**
- Reduced entrepreneurial activity leading to slower economic growth.

- Loss of innovative businesses that could drive technological advancements and job creation.

### Conclusion

The current state of entrepreneurship and small business development in Poland presents a complex picture. While Poles have a strong inclination towards starting their own ventures, the negative impact of media reports and overly complex regulations is causing a significant decline in new business creation. This situation highlights the need for policy changes to support and encourage local entrepreneurs. Future considerations should focus on improving the regulatory environment, enhancing public perception of entrepreneurship, and providing necessary support structures to foster a more conducive ecosystem for small businesses. By addressing these issues, Poland can better leverage its entrepreneurial potential and drive economic growth.
