**Key Themes**: The key themes discussed in the text include the decline in Polish housing loans, the impact of economic factors on the real estate market, inflation effects, and the government's response to these issues.

**Impacts**: 
- **Economic**: The decrease in housing loans impacts development companies negatively, as demand for construction declines. The rise in rental prices is influenced by the influx of Ukrainian refugees.
- **Technological**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied that digital platforms like Expandera and Rentier.io are being used to gather data on rent rates.
- **Political**: The Polish government's attempts to address the housing market, such as considering additional fees for bulk flat purchases, reflect political intervention.
- **Social**: The crisis in the housing market affects individuals' access to affordable housing, especially given the presence of Ukrainian refugees and the high number of new arrivals needing accommodation.

**Examples and Evidence**:
- According to the Office of Credit Information, housing loans have fallen by 70% compared to a year ago.
- Rent rates slightly decreased after continuous increases due to factors such as the arrival of millions of refugees from Ukraine.
- The government is considering additional fees on companies buying flats in bulk to protect local homebuyers.

**Opportunities and Risks**:
- **Opportunities**: Potential for government policies to stabilize the market, although this may require bold interventions.
- **Risks**: The housing market's instability could lead to further economic downturns if not addressed effectively; high inflation rates could exacerbate these risks.

**Conclusion**: The Polish real estate market is facing significant challenges due to a decline in housing loans and the influx of Ukrainian refugees. While there are attempts by the government to intervene, the text suggests that these measures may not be enough to address the structural issues within the market. Addressing inflation and implementing comprehensive strategies to stabilize the housing market will be critical in the coming years.
