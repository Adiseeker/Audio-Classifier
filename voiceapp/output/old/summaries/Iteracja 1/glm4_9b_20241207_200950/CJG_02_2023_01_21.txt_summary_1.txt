### Key Themes:
- The financial impact of film production costs.
- Misalignment between high investment and low returns on large productions.
- The influence of big companies in shaping public perception of movies through media manipulation.
- Negative effects on culture and creativity due to excessive corporate control.

### Impacts:
- **Economic**: Large losses from major productions suggest an economic imbalance between investments and returns, possibly leading to a market correction or reevaluation of film production models.
- **Technological**: The focus on high budgets in cinema may lead to over-reliance on technology rather than storytelling, potentially diminishing the cinematic art form.
- **Political**: Media manipulation can influence public opinion and cultural preferences, affecting political dynamics in terms of media regulation and content oversight.
- **Social**: High expectations from expensive productions may lead to disappointment and disillusionment among audiences, affecting consumer trust and engagement with cinema.

### Examples and Evidence:
- The example of "Rings of Power" illustrates the excessive spending by a major company, Amazon, which did not yield expected results, despite extensive media promotion.
- Similar issues are found in the production of games based on Polish intellectual property, like "The Witcher," where creativity was overshadowed by corporate interests.

### Opportunities and Risks:
- **Opportunities**: There may be an opportunity for new models of film production that focus more on storytelling over budget size. Additionally, independent films might gain more traction as audiences become wary of high-cost productions.
- **Risks**: The risk is the further centralization of power in a few large companies and the potential decline in creativity and diversity within the industry.

### Conclusion:
The text highlights the issues of economic misalignment in cinema, media manipulation by big companies, and the risks these situations pose to cultural integrity and audience trust. It suggests that future considerations should involve reevaluating production models and media oversight to ensure a balance between financial investments and creative outputs. The conversation hints at the need for public awareness about these matters and encourages listeners to engage in discussions on the topic of mass culture's impact on economy and society.
