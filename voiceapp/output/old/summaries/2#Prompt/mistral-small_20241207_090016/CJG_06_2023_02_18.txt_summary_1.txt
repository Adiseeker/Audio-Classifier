### **Key Themes**
1. **Economic Development**: The text emphasizes the importance of cheap energy for economic growth and development, particularly in the context of Poland's economy.
2. **Environmental Pollution**: It highlights issues related to air pollution and its causes, including fossil fuel use and illegal waste importation from other countries.
3. **Health Implications**: The author discusses health problems associated with high concentrations of suspended dust particles, which lead to significant mortality rates.
4. **Economic Policies and Dependencies**: The text critiques current policies that aim to reduce fossil fuel use, arguing that these policies make energy more expensive and undermine Poland's economic stability.
5. **Geopolitical Concerns**: It raises concerns about the double standards in global pollution statistics and the impact of international trade on Polandâ€™s economy.

### **Impacts**
1. **Economic**: The shift towards more expensive energy sources can lead to a significant increase in costs for both businesses and consumers, potentially leading to economic instability and crisis.
2. **Technological**: Technological advancements aimed at reducing pollution may be hindered by the high cost of implementing new technologies.
3. **Political**: The text implies political pressures and inconsistencies in global environmental policies that disadvantage Poland.
4. **Social**: High levels of air pollution contribute to significant health issues, including mortality rates, while economic instability can lead to social unrest and mental health problems like depression and suicides.

### **Examples and Evidence**
1. **Energy Costs**: The author mentions the dramatic increase in coal prices from PLN 300 to PLN 2,000, illustrating the impact on economic stability.
2. **Health Statistics**: It is stated that approximately 50,000 people die annually in Poland due to diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust particles.
3. **Illegal Waste Importation**: The text refers to the significant amount of illegal waste imported from other countries, leading to increased air pollution and toxic substances in the environment.
4. **Global Pollution Statistics**: The author points out that China and the USA are responsible for about 90% of global pollution, highlighting the disparity in global environmental policies.

### **Opportunities and Risks**
1. **Opportunities**:
   - Improving energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy sources could potentially reduce dependency on expensive imports while maintaining economic stability.
   - Strengthening international cooperation to address global pollution issues more equitably.
2. **Risks**:
   - Continued reliance on expensive energy sources could exacerbate economic instability, leading to social unrest and health crises.
   - Failure to address illegal waste importation could further degrade air quality and public health.

### **Conclusion**
The text underscores the interconnected nature of environmental, economic, and social issues in Poland. While aiming for a cleaner environment is crucial, the rapid increase in energy costs poses significant risks to the economy and public health. Addressing these challenges requires a balanced approach that considers both environmental sustainability and economic stability. Further dialogue and action are necessary to mitigate the looming crisis and ensure long-term well-being for Polish citizens.
