**Key Themes:**

The text discusses Poland's economy from multiple perspectives, including its dependency on fossil fuels, environmental health impacts, and economic policies.

1. **Economic Dependency on Fossil Fuels:** It argues that Poland is heavily reliant on cheap energy sources provided by fossil fuels, which are being systematically devalued domestically.
2. **Environmental Health Concerns:** The text highlights significant public health issues related to pollution caused by high levels of suspended dust and the extensive presence of garbage in Poland. This contributes not only to environmental degradation but also to increased mortality rates due to health problems exacerbated by air quality.
3. **Economic Inconsistency with Moral Reasons:** There's a critique regarding how economic decisions that are morally questionable, like supporting China despite its aggressive behaviors or environmental damage, continue without sufficient reform.

**Impacts:**

1. **Economic Dimension:** The overreliance on fossil fuels and cheap energy leads to economic instability in Poland as the cost of these resources becomes unpredictable due to external influences.
2. **Technological Impact:** It suggests that the lack of technological investment towards cleaner sources of energy might impede sustainable development initiatives and global competitiveness.
3. **Political Dimension:** The economic policies criticized could lead to a loss of international goodwill, especially in terms of human rights concerns linked with China's policies and environmental degradation.
4. **Social Impacts:** There are potential health risks due to pollution that can affect the general population's well-being and quality of life.

**Examples and Evidence:**

The text uses data on increased mortality rates from air pollution and the illegal dumping of garbage, which contributes to toxic substances in the air as real-world examples of environmental degradation.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

1. **Opportunities:** The transition to cleaner energy sources could provide opportunities for economic growth, job creation in renewable sectors, and improved public health.
2. **Risks:** Relying on fossil fuels leads to economic risks such as price volatility, potential market disruptions from external factors, and negative impacts on human health.

**Conclusion:**

The text underscores the severity of Poland's economic situation linked with its reliance on fossil fuels and environmental pollution. It suggests that there is a need for significant changes in policy direction towards cleaner energy sources and sustainable development practices. Future considerations should involve aligning economic policies with moral principles, investing in green technologies, and addressing public health concerns related to environmental degradation.
