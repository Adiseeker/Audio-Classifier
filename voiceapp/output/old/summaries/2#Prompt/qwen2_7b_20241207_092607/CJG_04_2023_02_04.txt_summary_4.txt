- **Social Dimension:** Reveals disparities in societal ability to access credit based on economic knowledge and stability.

**Examples & Evidence:**
The text uses an analogy about alcohol and vodka (credit) availability affecting individuals' behavior, illustrating how lack of funds (not due to decreased desire but inability) could influence decisions differently among economically savvy versus less knowledgeable individuals.

**Opportunities and Risks:**
