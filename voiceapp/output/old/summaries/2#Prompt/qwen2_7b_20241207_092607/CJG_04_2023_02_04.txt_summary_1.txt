Socially, it highlights the gulf between those who understand economic concepts and are capable of managing finances wisely versus those who lack such knowledge.

2. **Examples and Evidence**:

It suggests that with better understanding and knowledge about financial matters, people can make wiser choices and avoid risks associated with over-reliance on debt, lack of confidence in future economic stability, and undue influence by corporations or financial institutions.
