2. The commercialization of cinema and its effects on artistic integrity and cultural values.
3. The role of streaming services in shaping the film industry and their potential to disrupt traditional business models.

**Impacts:**

Economic:
- The increasing power of big companies in the film industry leads to a homogenization of opinions, stifling creativity and diversity.
- The dominance of streaming services like Amazon puts pressure on studios to invest more money in productions, potentially leading to inflationary pressures.

Technological:
- The use of algorithms and AI-powered content recommendation systems by streaming services can amplify existing biases and influence consumer choices.
- The rise of streaming services has changed the way people consume movies, with a focus on binge-watching and instant gratification.

Political:
- The concentration of power in the hands of a few large companies raises concerns about monopolies and their potential to stifle competition and innovation.
- The pressure on studios to produce content that appeals to a broad audience can lead to watering down of artistic visions and compromise on creative freedom.

Social:
- The commercialization of cinema can lead to a decline in cultural values and an emphasis on profit over artistry.
- The influence of big companies on critical opinions can result in the suppression of dissenting voices and alternative perspectives.

**Examples and Evidence:**

* The case of "Rings of Power" from Tolkien's world, where Amazon Studio invested millions of dollars and still received negative reviews from critics and fans alike.
* The example of Sapkowski and Wied≈∫min, a Polish gaming studio that saw its creative work destroyed by a powerful company.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

Opportunities:

As streaming services continue to shape the industry, it is essential to explore opportunities for innovation and democratization while also addressing the risks posed by monopolies and algorithmic bias.
