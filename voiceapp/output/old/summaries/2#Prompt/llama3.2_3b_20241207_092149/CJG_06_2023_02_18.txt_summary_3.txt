**Examples and Evidence:**

1. The Polish economy's reliance on cheap energy from fossil fuels has led to a significant increase in healthcare costs due to air pollution-related illnesses.
2. China and the USA are among the largest polluters in the world, accounting for 90% of global pollution.
3. The degradation of Poland's environment is comparable to being treated like a "trashcan" by other countries, with toxic substances being dumped into the air and water.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

1. **Opportunity:** Investing in renewable energy sources could create new economic opportunities and jobs for Polish citizens.
2. **Risk:** Failure to address environmental degradation could lead to catastrophic consequences, including mass suicides and economic collapse.
