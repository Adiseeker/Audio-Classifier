**Key Themes:**

1. The influence of big companies on mass culture, specifically in the film industry.
2. The impact of corporate power on creative works and audiences.
3. The decline of market value due to over-investment by large corporations.

**Impacts:**

Economic:
- Big companies' significant investments can lead to unsustainable losses for smaller studios or creators.
- The concentration of market value in the hands of a few large corporations can harm diverse cultural offerings.

Technological:
- Advances in technology allow companies to exert more control over the production and dissemination of media content.

Political:
- Corporate power can influence public opinion through advertising, sponsorship, and ownership of critical voices.

Social:
- Over-investment by big companies can lead to an oversaturation of markets, making it difficult for smaller creators to stand out.
- This scenario may result in a decline in the perceived value of cultural productions that are created with less corporate backing.

**Examples and Evidence:**

1. The Amazon Studios' investment in "Rings of Power" from Tolkien's world, leading to significant losses despite its initial success claims.
2. The case of Sapkowski and Wied≈∫min, where a powerful company ruined the brand and the creators by over-investing in it.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

- Opportunities for smaller studios or independent creators to break through with unique stories and themes that avoid corporate homogenization.
- Risks for audiences if they become too dependent on big corporations' productions, potentially leading to a loss of diversity and innovation.

**Conclusion:**

The influence of big companies in the mass culture industry can have far-reaching impacts. While it may seem appealing to invest more money into a production to ensure its success, this approach often leads to over-saturation and the dismissal of creative works that don't fit corporate expectations. It's essential for audiences and creators alike to be aware of these dynamics to protect diverse cultural expressions and maintain a healthy balance between commercial interests and artistic freedom.
