### Key Themes:
1. **Influence of Wealth on Politics**: The text emphasizes that only those with significant financial resources can influence politics and regulations, suggesting that the wealthy "giants" hold disproportionate power.
2. **Credit and Future Faith**: It discusses how taking out long-term loans (credit) requires a faith in the future that one will be able to pay off the debt.
3. **Economic Education and Wisdom**: The text suggests that people often lack economic knowledge and wisdom, leading to poor financial decisions.

### Impacts:
1. **Economic**: Economic disparities can lead to political imbalances where wealthier individuals have more influence over policies affecting everyone.
2. **Technological**: Not directly addressed in the text.
3. **Political**: There is an implication that political systems are subject to manipulation by those with financial resources.
4. **Social**: The lack of economic knowledge among the general public may contribute to societal problems, such as increased debt and financial instability.

### Examples and Evidence:
- The comparison of people's willingness to take loans despite lacking foresight or knowledge is analogous to an alcoholic who stops drinking due to unavailability rather than increased wisdom.
- Banks' reluctance to provide preferential loans suggests a loss of faith in future economic stability.

### Opportunities and Risks:
1. **Opportunities**: Increased awareness about financial literacy can lead to better decision-making by individuals and more balanced political influence.
2. **Risks**: The continued lack of financial knowledge could perpetuate economic disparities and poor policy outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The text highlights the importance of economic education and wisdom in society, suggesting that a more informed public is critical for making smarter decisions. It implies that while wealth can wield significant political power, there is also a need for reforming the system to ensure it is not solely influenced by financial resources. Future considerations should include initiatives aimed at improving financial literacy among the population, thereby fostering a more equitable and financially responsible society.
