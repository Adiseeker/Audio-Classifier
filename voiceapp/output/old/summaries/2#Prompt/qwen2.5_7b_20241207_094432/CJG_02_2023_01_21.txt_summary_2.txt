The text discusses significant changes within the film industry, particularly focusing on the financial struggles of major productions and the impact of large corporations' strategies on movie reception and public opinion.

### Impacts

- **Economic Impact**: The text points out significant financial losses for major film productions, indicating a shift away from profitability in blockbuster movies.
- **Technological Impact**: Advanced production techniques and investments are discussed, which could imply ongoing technological advancements but also suggest that these technologies may not translate into commercial success as expected.
- **Political Impact**: Large companies influencing public perception through strategic marketing and buying out critical reviews demonstrates the political landscape of the film industry becoming more corporate-controlled.
- **Social Impact**: The decline in audience satisfaction due to over-commercialization and unrealistic expectations has led to a general downturn in mass culture, affecting broader social norms and tastes.

### Examples and Evidence

- **"Rings of Power" Example**: Amazon's investment of nearly $1 billion for the series "Rings of Power" resulted in significant losses despite initial media claims of success. This case exemplifies how large corporations can invest heavily but face backlash due to audience expectations.
- **Sapkowski and Wiedźmin Case**: The adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski’s "The Witcher" into a television series by Netflix was criticized for its deviation from the source material, leading to negative reception among fans. This illustrates the risk when big companies take creative liberties with beloved franchises.

### Opportunities and Risks

- **Opportunities**: There is an opportunity for smaller, independent productions that can connect more authentically with audiences without the pressure of high-budget marketing.
- **Risks**: Large corporations may further marginalize smaller creators by dominating media and critical discourse. This could lead to a homogenization of content and cultural products.

### Conclusion

The impact of corporate influence on public opinion through strategic marketing raises concerns about the authenticity and quality of entertainment content.
