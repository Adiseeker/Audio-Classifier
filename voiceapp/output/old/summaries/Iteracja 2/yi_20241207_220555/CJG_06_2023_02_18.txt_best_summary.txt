**Key Themes**: The primary theme discussed in the text is the economic and geopolitical implications of Poland's reliance on Russian coal. Mariusz Stefaniak explores how the price of this coal has skyrocketed due to sanctions against Russia, despite increases in production costs being unjustified. He raises concerns about moral dilemmas faced by countries attempting to sanction aggressive regimes while maintaining economic ties with them.

**Impacts**: The impacts discussed are wide-ranging, affecting not only Poland but potentially other nations grappling with similar trade decisions. Economically, it highlights the difficulty of implementing sanctions effectively without crippling economies through escalating energy costs and reliance on foreign suppliers. Politically, it raises questions about the morality of economic engagement with authoritarian regimes while simultaneously condemning aggression.

**Examples and Evidence**: Stefaniak provides examples from his country's experience to illustrate these points. Poland is currently importing coal ten times more expensive than a year ago due to increased world stocks post-invasion, despite no actual increase in production costs. He also uses the comparison between Russia as a supplier of coal (better quality at lower prices) and China for energy components, underscoring the complexity of maintaining economic relationships with aggressive nations while advocating for sanctions against them.

**Opportunities and Risks**: The risks are primarily political and economic in nature. Politically, it challenges the efficacy of international diplomacy and sanctions as a means to an end; economically, it questions whether cutting off trade ties entirely is feasible or advisable when faced with significant economic dependency on foreign suppliers like Russia.

**Conclusion**: Stefaniak concludes by suggesting that economies need careful navigation of these risks and opportunities. He argues against the notion of maintaining full diplomatic relations while engaging in substantial trade with a nation engaged in aggressive warfare, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced approach to international economic policy-making that considers not just immediate sanctions but also long-term economic stability. He advocates for a plan instead of panic when faced with challenges and the potential consequences of actions taken against other nations' aggression.
