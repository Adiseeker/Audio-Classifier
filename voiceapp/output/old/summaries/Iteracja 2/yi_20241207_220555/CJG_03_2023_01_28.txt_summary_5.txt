The provided text discusses the impact of political correctness on the film industry, specifically focusing on the issue of casting decisions being influenced by ideological considerations rather than artistic merit. Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation and an economist, argues that the increasing presence of minorities in films, such as black actors playing elves or homosexual characters, is unnecessary and detrimental to the quality of productions. He points out that bad actors, directors, or showrunners are often hired based on their political or ideological alignment rather than their ability to produce high-quality content.

Stefaniak compares this situation to the use of political commissars in socialist unions, who were placed in positions regardless of their competence as managers or commanders but had a decisive voice due to their adherence to the prevailing ideology. This practice often led to the promotion of mediocrity and was seen as infringing on artistic freedom.

In the context of films today, Stefaniak criticizes the requirement for certain percentages of actors from minority groups in productions, arguing that it puts undue pressure on directors and writers to include these elements regardless of their relevance or impact on the story. He believes this undermines the creative process and leads to the inclusion of poor-quality content under the guise of political correctness.

Stefaniak's argument touches upon broader concerns about the role of politics in cultural productions, suggesting that there is a loss of artistic autonomy when decisions are made based on ideological considerations rather than artistic merit or audience satisfaction. He concludes by stating that viewers simply want good entertainment without being subjected to political propaganda or poorly executed stories, and calls for a return to quality over ideology in film and television production.

Overall, the text highlights concerns about the impact of political correctness on the creative arts, arguing that it leads to the promotion of mediocrity under the guise of diversity and inclusion, ultimately harming the quality of films and diminishing artistic freedom.
