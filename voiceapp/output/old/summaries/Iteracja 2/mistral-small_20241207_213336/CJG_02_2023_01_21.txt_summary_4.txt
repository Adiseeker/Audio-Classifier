### Examples and Evidence

1. **"Rings of Power"**: Amazon Studios' investment of nearly $1 billion into this project resulted in significant losses and a backlash from viewers and experts who found the production lacking despite positive media coverage.
2. **Sapkowski's "Wiedźmin" (The Witcher)**: The adaptation of Sapkowski’s works by a large production company led to fan protests and even caused a leading actor to leave the project due to dissatisfaction with how the source material was handled.

### Opportunities and Risks

1. **Opportunities**: There is an opportunity for independent experts and viewers to have a more significant voice in critiquing major productions, potentially leading to better quality content that aligns more closely with audience expectations.
2. **Risks**: The industry faces risks of further financial losses if it continues to disregard public sentiment and relies heavily on corporate-driven media narratives. This could lead to a continued decline in market performance and trust from consumers.

### Conclusion

The text underscores the importance of balancing financial investments with audience expectations and cultural sensitivity in film production. The mismanagement of major productions not only leads to significant economic losses but also erodes consumer trust and can result in social backlash. To prevent further decline, the industry should prioritize transparency and fair representation of cultural elements, while also ensuring that critical reception is not solely driven by corporate influence. Future actions should focus on rebuilding consumer confidence through improved content quality and honest engagement with audiences.
