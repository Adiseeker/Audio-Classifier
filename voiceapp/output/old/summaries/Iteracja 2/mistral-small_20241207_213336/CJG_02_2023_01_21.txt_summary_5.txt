**Key Themes:**
The primary themes discussed in the text revolve around the financial struggles of major film studios, particularly their significant losses in 2022, and the discrepancy between perceived successes and actual audience reception. Key examples include "Rings of Power," a Tolkien adaptation by Amazon Studios, and a Polish adaptation of "Wiedźmin." The text also touches on the manipulation of media outlets and critics by large corporations to promote their content.

**Impacts:**
1. **Economic**: Major film studios incurred substantial losses, highlighting financial risks associated with high-budget productions that fail to meet audience expectations.
2. **Technological**: The text does not delve into technological impacts, but it implies a need for better metrics and evaluation systems to assess movie success beyond corporate promotion.
3. **Political**: There are no direct political implications discussed.
4. **Social**: The manipulation of media outlets and critics erodes trust between corporations and audiences, potentially leading to a decline in viewership as people feel their opinions are not valued or represented accurately.

**Examples and Evidence:**
- "Rings of Power" by Amazon Studios faced criticism despite being promoted as a significant success. The discrepancy between corporate claims and audience reception underscores the manipulation tactics used to control public perception.
- The Polish adaptation of "Wiedźmin" also serves as an example, where fan backlash due to perceived disrespect for the source material led to negative outcomes, including the departure of a leading actor in protest.

**Opportunities and Risks:**
- **Opportunities**: There is an opportunity for more transparent evaluation systems that better reflect audience opinions. Independent experts could play a larger role in assessing movie quality.
- **Risks**: Continued manipulation of media outlets can lead to further erosion of trust between audiences and film studios, potentially resulting in decreased viewership and revenue.

**Conclusion:**
The text implies that the current model of promoting high-budget productions through corporate influence is unsustainable. To rebuild trust with audiences, the industry should consider more transparent evaluation methods and give greater weight to independent expert opinions. Future actions could include developing new metrics for assessing movie success beyond box office numbers and implementing stricter guidelines against manipulating media outlets.
