The text primarily focuses on the Polish real estate market's current state, marked by a significant decline in housing loans, falling prices for both flats and rent, and the impact of economic conditions on the industry.

### Impacts:
- **Economic**: The drop in loans affects development companies negatively, indicating an economic downturn in the real estate sector. Inflation and high interest rates contribute to the increasing cost of loans.

### Examples and Evidence:

- The average rent has increased despite a slight fall in the past 10 months.
- A prediction that prices should drop significantly (30%) was made based on the number of Ukrainian refugees entering Poland, which caused an unusual market demand.

### Opportunities and Risks:

- **Risks**: Further economic instability due to high inflation and interest rates, potentially leading to a deeper real estate market crash or prolonged recession.
