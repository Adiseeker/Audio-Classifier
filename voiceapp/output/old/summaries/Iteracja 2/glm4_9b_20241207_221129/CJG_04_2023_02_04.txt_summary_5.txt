**3. Examples and Evidence:**
The text uses an analogy of an alcoholic unable to buy vodka to illustrate that simply being denied access to something doesn't necessarily make a person more wise. This metaphor is used to describe how people might react to banks not lending money, implying a lack of fundamental changes in their financial behavior.
