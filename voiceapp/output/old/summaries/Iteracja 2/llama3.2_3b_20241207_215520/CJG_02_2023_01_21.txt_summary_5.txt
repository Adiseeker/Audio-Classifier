**Key Themes:**

1. The dominance of big companies in the film industry, particularly their influence on critical reception and audience opinions.
2. The impact of high production budgets on films, leading to over-saturation and a decline in market value.
3. The commodification of creative work, where large corporations prioritize profit over artistic merit.
4. The exploitation of intellectual property rights, as seen in the case of Sapkowski's book and Wiedźmin series.

**Impacts:**

1. Economic impact: Big companies' dominance leads to a decline in market value for films with lower budgets, affecting the economy of independent producers and studios.
2. Technological impact: The emphasis on high production budgets can stifle innovation and limit the development of new technologies.
3. Political impact: The concentration of creative industries in the hands of large corporations raises concerns about censorship, propaganda, and the suppression of alternative voices.
4. Social impact: The commodification of creative work can lead to a loss of artistic merit, promoting homogenization and reducing cultural diversity.

**Examples and Evidence:**

1. "Rings of Power" from Tolkien's world, which was expected to be a monumental production but ultimately failed to meet expectations due to high production costs.
2. The Wiedźmin series, where a powerful company destroyed the creative work of Sapkowski and Polish gaming studio, leading to fan backlash and protests.
3. The phenomenon of big companies buying out critics and influencing critical reception, as seen in the film industry.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

1. Opportunities for independent producers and studios to find alternative distribution channels and markets that value artistic merit over commercial success.
2. Risks of increased homogenization and reduction of cultural diversity if large corporations continue to dominate the creative industries.
3. Potential benefits from technological innovations emerging from the need for more efficient and cost-effective production methods.

**Conclusion:**

The text highlights a disturbing trend in the film industry, where big companies prioritize profit over artistic merit, leading to a decline in market value for independent productions and a homogenization of cultural diversity. To mitigate this issue, it is essential to explore alternative distribution channels, promote innovation and technological advancements, and protect intellectual property rights that favor creators rather than corporations. Future considerations should focus on finding ways to balance commercial success with artistic merit, ensuring that the creative industries continue to serve as a driving force for culture and society.
