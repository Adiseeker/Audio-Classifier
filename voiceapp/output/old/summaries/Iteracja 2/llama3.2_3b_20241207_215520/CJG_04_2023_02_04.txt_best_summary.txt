**Key Themes:**

1. The Polish real estate market is facing a crisis due to the decrease in loan applications from households.
2. Despite the decrease in loans, there has been no significant decrease in housing prices, leading to an "ice age" in the market.
3. The influx of Ukrainian refugees has contributed to the abnormality of the situation.

**Impacts:**

1. Economic impact: The crisis is affecting development companies and banks that are struggling to find buyers for apartments.
2. Technological impact: The online data from Expandera and Rentier.io highlights the decline in rent rates, with 9 out of 16 cities experiencing decreases or stable prices.
3. Political impact: The government's response to the crisis includes imposing additional fees on companies buying flats in bulk, which may aim to protect households but is seen as ineffective by Mariusz Stefaniak.
4. Social impact: The situation is affecting Poles who are struggling to buy or rent apartments due to the lack of financing options.

**Examples and Evidence:**

1. The data from the Office of Credit Information shows a 30% decrease in loan applications, while housing prices remain stable.
2. The report from Expandera and Rentier.io shows that rent rates have fallen for 9 out of 16 cities, with only 2 experiencing no changes.
3. Mariusz Stefaniak's predictions were accurate, as the decline in housing prices was predicted by him.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

1. Opportunities: The situation may lead to a drop in housing prices, making it more affordable for Poles to buy or rent apartments.
2. Risks: The crisis may have long-term consequences on the Polish economy, and the government's response may not be effective in addressing the issue.

**Conclusion:**

The Polish real estate market is facing an unprecedented crisis due to the decrease in loan applications from households. Despite this, housing prices remain stable, contributing to the "ice age" in the market. The influx of Ukrainian refugees has contributed to the abnormality of the situation. The government's response may not be effective in addressing the issue, and further measures are needed to support households struggling to buy or rent apartments. As Mariusz Stefaniak notes, the crisis is a symptom of a deeper, structurally unhealthy market system that needs to be addressed.
