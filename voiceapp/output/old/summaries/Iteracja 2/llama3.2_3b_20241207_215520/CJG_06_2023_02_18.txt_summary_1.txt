**Key Themes:**

1. The Polish economy is facing significant challenges due to its reliance on fossil fuels and lack of control over energy costs.
2. Environmental degradation, particularly air pollution, poses a threat to public health and the economy.
3. China's influence on Poland's economic development is seen as detrimental, with the country profiting from Poland's dependence on fossil fuels.

**Impacts:**

1. Economic impacts: The reliance on fossil fuels and lack of control over energy costs are causing financial strain on the Polish economy.
2. Environmental impacts: Air pollution is having devastating effects on public health, with an estimated 50,000 deaths per year in Poland due to diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust.
3. Social impacts: The economic instability and environmental degradation are leading to stress, depression, and potentially suicidal tendencies among the population.

**Examples and Evidence:**

1. The example of China's dominance in global pollution, with the country responsible for about 90% of all pollution, highlights the need for Poland to reevaluate its relationships and energy sources.
2. The comparison of Poland's economic development to that of other countries reveals the country's reliance on cheap energy as a significant weakness.
3. Statistics on air pollution and its effects on public health demonstrate the urgency of addressing these issues.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

1. Opportunities: Poland could explore alternative energy sources, invest in renewable energy technologies, and strengthen international relationships to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
2. Risks: Failure to address environmental degradation and economic instability may lead to widespread suffering, including mass suicides and depression.

**Conclusion:**

The Polish economy is facing significant challenges due to its reliance on fossil fuels and lack of control over energy costs. Environmental degradation poses a major threat to public health, while China's influence on Poland's economic development is seen as detrimental. The current situation demands urgent action to address these issues, including investing in alternative energy sources, strengthening international relationships, and implementing policies to reduce pollution. Failure to act may lead to devastating consequences for the population and economy.
