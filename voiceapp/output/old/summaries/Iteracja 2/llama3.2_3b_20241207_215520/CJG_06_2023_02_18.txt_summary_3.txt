Risks:

1. Economic disruption: A rapid transition to renewable energy could disrupt the economy, particularly in countries like Poland that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels.
2. Human health consequences: Continued reliance on fossil fuels will exacerbate environmental damage, which can have devastating effects on human health.
3. Loss of economic competitiveness: Failure to adapt to changing energy markets could lead to a loss of economic competitiveness for Poland and other countries.

**Conclusion**

The speaker's concerns about the state of Poland's economy and environment are well-founded. The country's reliance on fossil fuels, particularly coal mining, has severe environmental consequences. International cooperation is necessary to address these issues, but a rapid transition to renewable energy could also create new economic opportunities. It is essential for policymakers to prioritize sustainability and take concrete steps to reduce the country's carbon footprint.
