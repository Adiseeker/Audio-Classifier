**Key Themes:**

1. Economic development and the impact of fossil fuels on Poland's economy.
2. Environmental pollution and its effects on public health.
3. International relations and trade agreements between Poland and other countries, particularly China.

**Impacts:**

* Economic impacts: High energy costs due to dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to potential economic instability and bankruptcy.
* Environmental impacts: Air pollution from fossil fuels, waste management issues, and the spread of diseases caused by high concentration of suspended dust.
* Social impacts: Potential for mass suicides and depression due to stress and lack of hope caused by economic instability.

**Examples and Evidence:**

* Poland's dependence on foreign energy suppliers leads to high costs and potential economic instability (e.g., the price increase from PLN 300 to PLN 2,000).
* China is the biggest pollutant in the world, responsible for about 90% of all pollution.
* The "trashcan" phenomenon, where Poland is a recipient of large amounts of illegally imported garbage, causing significant air pollution and health issues.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

* Opportunities: Investing in renewable energy sources, developing sustainable economic systems, and promoting environmental protection.
* Risks: Continuing to rely on fossil fuels, ignoring international cooperation and trade agreements, and failing to address environmental and social issues.

**Conclusion:**

The text highlights the urgent need for Poland to reevaluate its dependence on foreign energy suppliers and take steps to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. The country must also prioritize environmental protection, address waste management issues, and promote sustainable economic development. Failure to do so may lead to severe economic consequences, including bankruptcy and mass suicides. It is essential for Poland to engage in international cooperation and trade agreements that prioritize environmental protection and sustainability.
