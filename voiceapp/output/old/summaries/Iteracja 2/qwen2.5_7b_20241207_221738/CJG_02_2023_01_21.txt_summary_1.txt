There is an urgent need for a shift towards more authentic and quality-driven content creation, driven by genuine audience feedback rather than artificial marketing efforts. Future considerations should focus on fostering a more transparent and equitable environment in which smaller players can compete fairly, ensuring that cultural heritage and creativity are not undermined by excessive corporate influence.
