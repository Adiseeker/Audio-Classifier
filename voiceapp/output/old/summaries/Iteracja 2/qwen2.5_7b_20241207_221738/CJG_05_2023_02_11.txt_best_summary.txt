### Key Themes

The text discusses the current state and challenges faced by small businesses in Poland. It highlights themes such as declining entrepreneurial activity, media influence on perceptions, business complexity, and comparisons with other countries.

### Impacts

- **Economic**: The decrease in new company openings and a rise in closures could negatively impact economic growth and job creation.
- **Technological**: No specific mention of technology impacts, but the ease or difficulty of running businesses can affect innovation and digital adoption.

### Examples and Evidence

1. **Entrepreneurship Rates**:
   - Poles are globally recognized as strong entrepreneurs, with 78% believing in the success of running a business (European average is 69%). However, only 6% of Poles want to start a company by 2022, compared to the European average of 12%.

2. **Media Influence**:
   - Media coverage shifted from positive (58% in 2016) to negative (37% in 2019), showing a decline in support for entrepreneurs.

3. **Business Complexity and Support**:
   - Poland ranks second in Europe and tenth globally with the most complex business rules, making it harder for new businesses.
   - Countries like Switzerland have more favorable conditions, leading to better entrepreneurial outcomes.

### Opportunities and Risks

- **Opportunities**: 
  - Potential for policy reforms that simplify the business environment could attract more entrepreneurs.
  - Increased media support and positive publicity could also boost confidence in entrepreneurship.

- **Risks**:
  - Continued high complexity of business rules may discourage new ventures, leading to stagnation or decline in entrepreneurial activity.
  - Negative perceptions from media could further dampen interest among potential entrepreneurs.

### Conclusion

The current trends indicate a significant shift away from entrepreneurship in Poland. While the nation has a strong historical and cultural foundation for small businesses, recent data suggests a growing pessimism and difficulty. Addressing the high complexity of business rules and fostering more positive media coverage are critical steps to revitalize the entrepreneurial spirit. Future considerations should focus on simplifying regulations, enhancing support structures, and promoting entrepreneurship through education and media outreach.
