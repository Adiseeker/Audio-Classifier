The statement provided is a conversation between Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation, and Krzysztof Strauchman, likely discussing various topics including film ratings, racial representation in movies, and viewer opinions. 

Mariusz Stefaniak argues that there is a double standard when it comes to representing minorities in films, particularly focusing on race and sexuality. He points out how the inclusion of black actors or homosexuals on screen has become commonplace without causing controversy, while other aspects like bad performances or direction are tolerated less due to their potential political implications. Stefaniak criticizes the idea that filmmakers are being forced to include certain racial minorities as percentages dictated by funding bodies to keep projects funded rather than because of artistic merit.

Krzysztof Strauchman engages with Stefaniak's points, acknowledging the changing social norms but questioning the way these standards are enforced and the potential impact on film quality and viewer enjoyment. He raises concerns about the use of political correctness to dictate casting choices and criticizes the idea that weak actors or directors can be protected from being replaced by more talented ones because they align with certain ideological agendas.

In summary, this conversation highlights the tension between artistic freedom and social responsibility in contemporary film production, particularly regarding representation issues, viewer expectations, and the impact of political correctness on creative expression. 

The conclusion emphasizes the importance of maintaining high-quality entertainment that reflects diversity without sacrificing artistic integrity or engaging in tokenism. It calls for a dialogue about what good filmmaking means in an increasingly politically charged environment while ensuring that viewers are not unfairly labeled or marginalized based on their preferences and opinions.
