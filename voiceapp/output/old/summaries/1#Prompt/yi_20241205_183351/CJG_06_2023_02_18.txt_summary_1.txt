The statement provided by the guest on the radio show reflects a deep concern about the economic and environmental policies of Poland, particularly regarding fossil fuels and their impact on health and economic stability. The guest raises several points that highlight the issues faced in Poland:

1. **Health Issues Due to Air Pollution**: The guest notes that air pollution in Poland, especially in urban areas and small towns like cities during winter, causes a significant number of deaths each year due to suspended dust and toxic substances. They also point out that illegal waste burning contributes greatly to this pollution problem but is often overlooked or ignored by authorities.
   
2. **Economic Impacts**: The guest discusses how the reliance on coal and other fossil fuels at exorbitant prices (e.g., coal from PLN 300 jumping to PLN 2,000) leads to economic instability and hardship for the population. This situation is seen as leading down a path of increasing crisis and suffering, both immediate (starvation and job losses) and long-term (mass suicides due to economic collapse and societal breakdown).

3. **Global Pollution Contribution**: The guest emphasizes that while China is currently the world's largest polluter by volume, other countries, including Poland through its coal consumption practices, contribute significantly to global pollution levels and associated health hazards.

4. **Sustainability and Morality**: They question why it seems acceptable for Poland (and other nations) to act morally in certain areas while simultaneously engaging in harmful practices that lead to environmental degradation and human suffering. The guest suggests that a consistent ethical stance, including reducing dependence on unsustainable energy sources and addressing global waste issues, would be beneficial not only for the economy but also for the well-being of humanity.

5. **Crisis Preparedness**: The statement hints at a potential future crisis scenario in Poland, where economic collapse could lead to widespread depression, suicides, and societal breakdowns due to lack of hope. This serves as a stark warning against complacency regarding current challenges facing the country's economy and environment.

In conclusion, the guest raises significant concerns about the state of Polish economy and environmental policies, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices, ethical considerations in economic decisions, and preparedness for potential crises to protect public health, well-being, and economic stability.
