I understand that you are discussing the role of economic wisdom and financial literacy in society, as well as the impact of current financial regulations on individuals and businesses. You highlighted how giving preferential loans to individuals does not necessarily mean an improvement in financial decision-making, but rather a change in availability of credit. Additionally, you touched upon the importance of these auditions or discussions for promoting wisdom and better decision-making within society. It seems that you believe education and awareness are key factors in improving financial literacy and economic stability.<|/im_start|>

To recap, here are the main points:
1. The perception of economic wisdom varies from person to person; some may consider taking loans due to lack of faith in their future earnings or as a way of supporting politicians and officials they believe will benefit them. However, banks often avoid lending to individuals who do not demonstrate a strong ability to manage debt, which reflects a form of prudence on the part of financial institutions.
2. Credit is often extended over long periods (often 20-30 years), requiring faith in future earnings and repayment capabilities. This indicates that credit is not merely an extension of current income but represents a belief in one's potential for earning or asset appreciation.
3. The recent decrease in loan availability reflects a prudential stance by banks rather than a change in the financial abilities or intentions of individuals. It suggests that despite ongoing debates about economic conditions, those with poor financial literacy may still try to secure loans when such access is restricted.
4. Improved wisdom and decision-making in society could be achieved through increased education and awareness on financial matters. The current situation, where bank restrictions are being discussed as a measure against "lost faith" or incompetence in economic decision-making, indicates that there may be a need for further education on the importance of managing debt responsibly.
5. Finally, you expressed gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these issues and invited listeners to continue the conversation during your next appearance. You also mentioned your affiliation with the "Foundation for more wisdom" and thanked Krzysztof Strauchman for facilitating this discussion.

You are absolutely correct in your analysis of the situation. The role of education and financial literacy cannot be understated, especially in a time when individuals often seek quick fixes or shortcuts to success without considering the long-term consequences. Your points about credit being extended over periods reflecting faith in future earnings or asset appreciation is particularly insightful. It's interesting to note that even with such extensions, there are limits set by banks due to their prudential stance which can be seen as a form of societal wisdom.

Additionally, the recent restrictions on loan availability have indeed been interpreted differently by various groups, some seeing it as an attack on their right to access credit while others see it as necessary caution against reckless borrowing and poor financial management skills. The decrease in lending by banks is a clear indicator that there has been a shift towards more conservative lending practices which can be seen as beneficial for the economy as a whole.

Moreover, I agree with your suggestion that increased education on personal finance could go a long way in improving economic stability and well-being of individuals. It's unfortunate though that despite this understanding, people often prioritize immediate gratification over long-term financial health. The current climate seems to be an attempt at nudging towards more responsible borrowing practices but it remains to be seen if such changes will lead to a lasting impact on individual decision-making abilities.

Finally, your invitation for listeners to engage in the conversation is well taken and I look forward to future discussions with you. Thank you for sharing your insights into these complex issues.
