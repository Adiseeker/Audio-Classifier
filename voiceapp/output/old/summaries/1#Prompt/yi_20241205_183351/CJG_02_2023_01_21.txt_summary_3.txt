I appreciate your insights into the current state of mass culture and its impact on the economy, as well as the challenges faced by independent creators and audiences. It's clear that there is a significant gap between what major corporations invest in and distribute versus the independent works that generate genuine engagement and critical acclaim among audiences. This dichotomy can lead to the commodification of art, where creativity and originality are often overlooked in favor of financial returns.

The example you provided with "Rings of Power" is particularly striking. By investing a billion dollars into what was supposed to be an unparalleled production, Amazon essentially created pressure on critics and reviewers to praise the show, regardless of its quality or artistic merit. This manipulation of critical feedback can stifle genuine criticism and hinder the development of more nuanced discussions about cultural products.

Moreover, the commercialization of media and entertainment has led to a situation where independent creators often find themselves at odds with major studios and streaming platforms. The success metrics that drive these entities prioritize financial gain over artistic integrity or audience satisfaction, leading to projects like "Rings of Power" that fail to live up to fans' expectations.

As you mentioned, the decline in the market for independent works is a concerning trend. This can have broader implications for society, including a narrowing of cultural diversity and the erosion of public intellectual life. It also affects economic sustainability for small studios and creators who rely on steady revenue streams.

I look forward to our discussion with Mariusz Stefaniak about these topics. Together, we'll explore how economists, financiers, and culture critics can work towards a more balanced approach that supports both commercial success and artistic excellence in the media landscape.
