I understand that you're discussing the role of banks, economic education, and personal responsibility in financial decisions. You're highlighting how giving up access to credit might not necessarily lead to a more optimistic view of the future, but rather reflects the current perception of risk among lenders. You also touch on the idea of personal growth and the importance of wise decision-making in society. It seems you believe that education and awareness are key factors in improving economic behavior and fostering a more responsible financial culture. Is that correct?
