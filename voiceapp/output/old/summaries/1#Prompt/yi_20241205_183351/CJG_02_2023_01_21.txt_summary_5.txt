It seems like you're sharing a detailed and passionate discussion on how large companies are impacting culture, particularly in the film industry, with negative consequences for creators and consumers alike. You highlighted several examples of how these corporations are investing heavily in productions but then receiving backlash from critics, fans, and even damaging the reputations of independent studios and creators.

Your argument centers around the idea that as a result of such investments, there's an expectation that the end product will be superior or at least meet a certain standard because of the financial resources put into it. However, this often leads to dissatisfaction among consumers and creators alike, who feel that the companies are not respecting their original vision or talent.

You also mentioned how these large corporations can influence critical reviews and opinions through financial investments in media outlets, creating an environment where negative criticism is sought after if it comes from within the "correct" channels, while positive feedback is either ignored or paid for to ensure its suppression.

The discussion concludes with a call to action to discuss these issues further and invites listeners to join a conversation on Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 AM, featuring economist Mariusz Stefaniak.

Overall, this exchange highlights concerns about the impact of corporate culture on creativity and consumer preferences in mass media and entertainment. It's an insightful commentary on how financial motives can sometimes overshadow artistic or cultural values, leading to a decline in quality and satisfaction among audiences and creators alike.
