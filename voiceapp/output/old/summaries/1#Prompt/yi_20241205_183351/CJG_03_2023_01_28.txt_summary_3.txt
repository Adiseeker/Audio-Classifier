It seems like you're quoting a specific conversation or debate between several individuals on a radio show regarding film industry practices, the role of political ideology in casting decisions, and viewer reactions to such choices. The primary points discussed include:

1. **Box Office Performance and Critic Ratings**: A comparison is made between the critical and audience ratings for two iterations of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies. One version received high ratings from both critics (95% from viewers) but faced criticism over certain casting choices, while another version had lower ratings (38% from viewers) due to perceived ideological bias in casting decisions.

2. **Ideological Casting Decisions**: The concern is raised about the current practice of including minority actors and portraying homosexual relationships as part of modern film productions. Critics argue that it's not the specific racial or sexual identities but the political ideology behind these choices that is causing the controversy, rather than the quality of acting or storytelling.

3. **Viewer Reactions to Political Ideology in Movies**: The discussion touches upon how viewers react negatively to certain casting decisions based on perceived ideological reasons over artistic merit. There's a growing sentiment among audiences who feel pressured to watch films for political correctness and diversity, rather than because of their quality as stories or performances.

4. **The Role of Political Commissars in the Past**: A comparison is made between the current situation with regard to ideological casting choices and historical parallels involving "political commissars" (individuals appointed due to their ideology) who could influence creative decisions during times of political censorship, even if they had limited competence as managers or commanders.

5. **Financial Implications**: The discussion also touches on the financial pressures faced by filmmakers when it comes to casting decisions and audience expectations based on specific diversity metrics (like percentages for minority representation) rather than artistic merit or talent selection. This leads to a situation where weaker actors are often cast due to their alignment with certain ideological agendas, just to ensure funding is secured.

6. **The Anger of Fans**: The conversation concludes by acknowledging the frustration felt by fans who do not agree with certain casting choices based on their political ideology rather than acting ability or storytelling quality. This has led to a rebellion among viewers against such practices, seeking only good stories and performances without ideological constraints.

In summary, this debate highlights several key issues within the film industry today: the tension between artistic merit and ideological considerations in casting; the financial pressures filmmakers face due to diversity metrics; and the potential for ideological bias impacting viewer enjoyment over quality storytelling.
