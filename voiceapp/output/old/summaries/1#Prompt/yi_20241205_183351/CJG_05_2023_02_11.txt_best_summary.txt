What Mr. Mariusz is saying here is that there seems to be a discrepancy between Poland being considered an entrepreneurial nation and the hesitation among Polish entrepreneurs in starting new businesses. He attributes this to changes in media perception towards entrepreneurship as well as difficulties in running small businesses due to complex business regulations, such as those regarding income tax.

Mr. Mariusz points out that while Poles greatly respect entrepreneurs and consider running a business a good idea (78% of Poles believe so), there's a significant drop in entrepreneurship rates as reflected in the ESA Business study between 2016 and 2019, where only 37% of Poles expressed interest in starting a new company within three years. Additionally, the index for young companies (those less than five years old) has declined from 9% to 5.4% over the same period while mature businesses have seen an increase.

This discrepancy could be due to several reasons:
1. External factors: The media in Poland might not encourage entrepreneurship as much as they should, possibly leading to a negative image of business ownership.
2. Complex regulations: As Mr. Mariusz points out, Poland is ranked 2nd globally for having the most complex business environment according to the Global Business Complexity Index in 2021. This suggests that running a small business here could be more difficult due to stringent regulations which may discourage entrepreneurship.
3. Income Tax: As mentioned earlier, the tax on corporate income tax (CIT) in Poland is relatively low at only 0.004% of income for Swiss companies compared to higher rates in Poland. This discrepancy might make it easier for companies located elsewhere with lower tax burdens to set up operations in Switzerland rather than Poland, further discouraging local entrepreneurship.
4. Attitudes towards business ownership: Mr. Mariusz suggests that the overall attitude towards entrepreneurs and business success may not be as supportive in Poland as it is in other countries. This could be due to cultural or societal factors that make starting a company less appealing compared to working for an established business or state institution.

In summary, while Poland has historically been considered one of the most entrepreneurial nations globally, the declining rate of entrepreneurship coupled with favorable conditions for foreign companies over domestic ones points towards challenges in maintaining this status and encouraging economic growth through small business development. 

Mr. Mariusz concludes by mentioning that these issues need to be addressed so that Polish entrepreneurs can feel encouraged and supported in their endeavors to start new businesses, as it is crucial for the country's economic prosperity.<|/im_start|>
