The statement made by the guest on the radio station highlights several critical issues concerning Poland's economy, health, and environmental policies. Here are some of the key points emphasized:

1. **Health Impacts of Environmental Pollution**: The guest raises concerns about the health effects caused by air pollution in Poland, particularly in urban centers like Warsaw. They estimate that around 50,000 people die every year due to diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust and toxic substances in the air. This highlights a significant environmental challenge facing Poland's cities and calls for greater action to address air quality issues.

2. **Economic Dependence on Fossil Fuels**: The guest criticizes the Polish government's policies regarding fossil fuels, arguing that they are "extorting" from the economy rather than promoting sustainable growth. This includes the practice of paying significantly higher rates for coal imports compared to other countries. They argue that this policy not only damages Poland's economy but also contributes to environmental degradation and health problems.

3. **Impact on Children**: The guest expresses concern about the future consequences of current economic policies, predicting that they could lead to widespread starvation among children in Poland. This is a stark warning against the potential long-term effects of economic decisions that prioritize short-term gains over sustainable development and social welfare.

4. **Depression and Suicide Rates**: The guest also discusses the increasing rates of depression and suicide due to the stress caused by economic crises, especially those related to energy dependence and environmental degradation. This highlights the broader mental health implications of unsustainable economic policies on a population's well-being.

5. **Urgent Need for Policy Reforms**: Throughout the statement, the guest calls for urgent reforms in Poland's economy, environment policy, and governance to address these issues before they spiral out of control. They argue that current practices are not only detrimental to the Polish people but also threaten global sustainability goals.

6. **Engagement with Public and Media**: The guest encourages others to pay attention to these issues, arguing that much of the discussion surrounding Poland's economic and environmental challenges remains hidden or ignored in mainstream media. They emphasize the need for public engagement and awareness about critical social and ecological problems facing Poland.

7. **Invitation to Guest for More Wisdom Hearing**: The statement concludes with an invitation from the radio station to Mariusz Stefania, President of "More Wisdom" Foundation, to appear on a series of discussions aimed at exploring these issues further. This indicates that the guest's insights are seen as valuable contributions to public discourse and policy-making in Poland.

In summary, the statement made by the guest serves as a powerful call for action against current economic policies that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability and social welfare. It raises urgent concerns about environmental degradation, health impacts, economic stability, and mental well-being, urging policymakers and the public to reconsider their approaches to development and governance.
