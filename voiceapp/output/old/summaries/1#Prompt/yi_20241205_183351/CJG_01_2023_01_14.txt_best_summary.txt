1 [music] What's going on, Mr. Mariusz? What did you hear again? I checked a few forecasts from the year before, which were set for 2022, and few of them turned out to be prophetic. Well, for example, the inflation forecast. Even the president of the National Bank of Poland was wrong. I think it's quite typical. Why else? Because he's an expert. Yes, some say that, but I say that there is a lot of pressure on most of the experts I know from most of the areas I have contact with. Even financial influence cases are documented on the position, opinion or decision of experts. And I don't think it should be a shock to anyone. Before we get to the topic, it's time to introduce our guest, and he is and will be our weekly guest, Mariusz Stefaniak. A man who connects many fields, both as a practitioner and as a theorist. Economist, financialist, manager, among other large IT companies, marketing specialist, and most of all, the president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation. Let's pay attention to the name - "Więcej Mądrości". Every week we will meet regularly and talk about the economy and the complexity of the world. Good morning, Mr..|
