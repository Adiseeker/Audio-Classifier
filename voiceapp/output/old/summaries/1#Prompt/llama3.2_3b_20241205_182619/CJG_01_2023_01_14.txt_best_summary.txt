I can help you with that. Here's an expanded version of your text:

It seems like you're having a conversation about economics, finance, and the world in general. You introduce Mariusz Stefaniak as a weekly guest on the show "Więcej Mądrości" (More Wisdom). The conversation starts with a discussion about how some economic forecasts were overly optimistic, such as the housing market and cryptocurrency market. 

Mariusz explains that the housing market is one of the most profitable markets in the world, which might contribute to overly optimistic forecasts. He also mentions China's real estate market and the cryptocurrency market, where forecasts seemed too good (e.g., Bitcoin being worth $120,000 in 2022).

The conversation then shifts to experts who make predictions. Mariusz notes that it's not necessarily a question of whether there are "bad" experts or if they're pressured by external factors. Instead, he suggests that it's often the case that the most well-liked and promoted experts aren't telling the truth, as their message might warn people about impending doom.

Mariusz uses the analogy of a shepherd leading sheep to slaughter to illustrate this point. He believes that governments, media, and large corporations tend to favor experts who provide positive forecasts rather than those who predict something more negative.

The conversation then touches on the COVID-19 pandemic. Mariusz explains that while the virus itself is still a deadly threat, its economic impact was much greater than its direct health effects. People have been exposed to various viruses throughout history and have largely survived. However, when it comes to economies and societies, these diseases can have a significant impact.

The conversation seems to be building up to Mariusz sharing some insights about the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly revealing that governments had 100% certain data on the attack months before it happened.

Before taking another break, you invite your guest, Mariusz Stefaniak, to share his thoughts on COVID-19. Unfortunately, I can only provide an expanded version of the initial text and not predict what Mariusz will say next.
