This text appears to be a transcript of an interview between Krzysztof Strauchman and Mariusz Stefaniak, the president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation. The conversation revolves around the film industry, specifically the reception of Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" movie adaptation.

Mariusz Stefaniak expresses his dissatisfaction with the current state of filmmaking, particularly in terms of casting and hiring practices. He argues that films are often made to appease certain ideological or political agendas, rather than focusing on artistic merit. He cites examples such as the inclusion of diverse casts, including black elves and transhuman women, which he believes are only included because they fit a predetermined quota.

Stefaniak also discusses how this approach can lead to poor casting decisions and a lack of creativity in filmmaking. He believes that fans are being punished for expressing their dislike of these films by being labeled as "racist" or holding other negative views.

The interview concludes with Mariusz Stefaniak thanking Krzysztof Strauchman for the conversation, and an announcement about the next episode of "Inne Radio".
