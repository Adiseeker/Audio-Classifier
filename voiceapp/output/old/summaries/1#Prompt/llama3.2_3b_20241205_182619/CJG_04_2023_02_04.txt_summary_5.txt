This text appears to be a transcript of an interview or conversation between Maciej Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert, and Krzysztof Strauchman. The conversation revolves around the topic of economic regulations, particularly regarding giant corporations and politicians having more influence over financial decisions than ordinary people.

Maciej Stefaniak discusses how giving large amounts of cash to individuals or organizations can be a fraction of what they could earn through investments and business activities. He also touches upon credit systems, stating that banks are less willing to give loans to ordinary people, suggesting that there is a decline in faith in the future and economic stability.

He emphasizes that people's willingness to take credit is not due to improved intelligence but rather because they cannot afford it. Maciej Stefaniak uses an analogy about alcoholism to illustrate this point, stating that someone who can no longer purchase vodka because of lack of money would still want to buy it if available.

The main points from the conversation are:

1. Economic regulations favor giants and politicians over ordinary people.
2. There is a decline in faith in future economic stability among ordinary individuals, leading them to be less likely to take credit.
3. The lack of willingness for credit among ordinary people is not due to improved intelligence or understanding but rather to financial constraints.

Maciej Stefaniak concludes by expressing the need for increased wisdom and smarter decision-making in society.
