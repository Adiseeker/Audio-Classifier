This appears to be a transcript of a radio interview or podcast, likely from a Polish source, as indicated by the mention of "Mr. Mariusz" (likely referring to Mariusz Stefaniak), a well-known economist and financial expert in Poland.

The conversation begins with the host, Krzysztof Strauchman, expressing his skepticism about the accuracy of information presented in media and political discussions, suggesting that many people are misinformed or unaware of fundamental issues. He shares his own experience as someone who has spent a lot of time studying business, finance, and politics, which has changed his perspective on these topics.

The host then references an old Latin saying, "If you want to reach the truth, follow the path of money," implying that understanding economic factors can provide valuable insights into various issues. He also mentions several current events (e.g., Bitcoin prices, fuel prices) and expresses skepticism about politicians' promises.

Throughout the conversation, the host aims to encourage listeners to think critically and consider alternative perspectives on hidden or less discussed topics. The tone is informal and conversational, with a focus on sparking interest and encouraging critical thinking.
