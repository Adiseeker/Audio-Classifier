It appears that you've shared a transcript of a radio conversation discussing the current state of mass culture, specifically the film industry. Here's a summary of the main points:

1. The cinema network is a significant contributor to big companies' wealth, with hundreds of millions of dollars generated from one movie.
2. In 2022, the biggest productions and studios experienced significant losses, amounting to $200 million or more per movie.
3. This trend is attributed to Amazon Studios' investment in "Rings of Power," a Tolkien adaptation series that received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike.
4. Amazon's influence on the film industry is seen as a problem, with some experts suggesting that they are buying critical reviews and manipulating rankings to promote their own content.
5. Similar scenarios have played out with other popular franchises, such as "The Witcher" series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's books, which was destroyed by Amazon Studios' production.
6. The consequences of this trend include a decline in the film industry's market value and a growing distrust among audiences towards studios and critics.

Overall, the conversation highlights concerns about the influence of corporate power in shaping popular culture and the erosion of artistic integrity in the film industry.
