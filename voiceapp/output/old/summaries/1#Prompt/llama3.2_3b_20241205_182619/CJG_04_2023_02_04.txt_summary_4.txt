The text is a transcript of an interview between Maciej Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert, and Krzysztof Strauchman. The conversation touches on various economic topics, including:

1. The power of wealthy individuals and institutions to influence politics and regulations.
2. The issue of credit and loans, particularly long-term loans that require faith in the future.
3. The notion that people's financial decisions are not driven by intelligence or wisdom, but rather by their ability to access credit.

Maciej Stefaniak argues that:

* Weary individuals may take out loans because they lack economic knowledge and are desperate for financial assistance, rather than due to a loss of faith in the future.
* Banks' reluctance to grant loans is not a result of people becoming smarter or more cautious, but rather due to changes in market conditions and their own risk aversion.

He uses an analogy about an alcoholic who suddenly can't afford vodka as a metaphor for how financial decisions are often driven by external factors rather than individual intelligence or wisdom.

The conversation aims to promote "more wisdom" in society and encourage smarter decision-making, particularly when it comes to financial matters.
