This is a transcript of a conversation between a journalist (Krzysztof Strauchman) and an economist, Mariusz Stefaniak, about the current state of Poland's economy, specifically regarding fuel prices, coal imports from Russia, and the impact of "sanctions" on the country.

Mariusz Stefaniak strongly disagrees with the notion that the war in Ukraine caused the recent surge in fuel prices. He believes that the sanctions imposed on Russia are not having the intended effect and that Poland's economy is being artificially crippled by government decisions to limit coal imports from Russia, despite no actual conflict between the two countries.

Stefaniak argues that the sanctions are a "media fake" and that Russian banks and companies continue to operate freely in China, for example. He also points out that Polish companies are not able to compete with Russian producers of coal due to high production costs, which have increased tenfold since the crisis began.

The economist also shares personal stories of ordinary Poles who are struggling to afford basic necessities like gas and coal due to rising prices. He highlights the absurdity of a country that is heavily reliant on coal yet cannot afford it anymore.

Throughout the conversation, Stefaniak emphasizes that Poland's economy is being held hostage by political decisions rather than economic realities. He concludes that the sanctions are not working as intended and that the country is facing a "nightmare" due to its own policy choices.

The journalist, Krzysztof Strauchman, seems open-minded and willing to consider alternative perspectives, but ultimately doesn't challenge Stefaniak's assertions or provide counterarguments. The conversation ends with a call for further exploration of the issue in future broadcasts.
