This is a transcript of a conversation between Krzysztof Strauchman, a Polish radio host, and Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financier, discussing the current state of the Polish economy, particularly in relation to energy prices.

Mariusz Stefaniak presents several points that challenge the common narrative about the causes of rising energy prices:

1. He disputes the claim that the war in Ukraine is responsible for the skyrocketing fuel prices, suggesting that political decisions, including sanctions and restrictions on Russian energy imports, are more likely to be the cause.
2. He argues that sanctions against Russia are ineffective, as they do not prevent the country from selling its energy resources through other countries, such as China.
3. He criticizes the Polish government's decision to stop importing coal from Russia, which he claims has led to a shortage and increased prices for domestic coal.
4. He points out that the prices of coal have risen by tenfold since the crisis began, despite Poland having its own coal mines.

Throughout the conversation, Mariusz Stefaniak emphasizes the negative consequences of these economic decisions, including massive bankruptcies of Polish companies and widespread poverty among ordinary citizens, who are struggling to afford basic necessities like heating fuel.

Krzysztof Strauchman seems to acknowledge some of these points but ultimately concludes the conversation without fully addressing the concerns raised by Mariusz Stefaniak.
