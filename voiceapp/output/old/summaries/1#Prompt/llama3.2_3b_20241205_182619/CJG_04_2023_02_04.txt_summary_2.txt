This appears to be a transcript of an interview with Maciej Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert. The conversation is about the current economic situation and how it affects people's decisions when it comes to borrowing money.

Maciej Stefaniak explains that giving 10 million in cash as a fraction of what one earns on it may not be feasible for many people, but giants (presumably referring to large corporations or wealthy individuals) are able to do so because they have influence over politicians and regulations. He also notes that credit is often taken out for long periods, requiring faith in the future, which can indicate a lack of confidence in one's ability to pay.

However, Maciej Stefaniak argues that it's not that people have lost faith in the future, but rather that banks are no longer willing to provide loans with favorable terms. He believes that if banks were to suddenly offer "super preferential" loans, the queue would be long because people would take advantage of such an opportunity.

The transcript also includes a personal anecdote about an alcoholic who cannot afford vodka anymore and will still want to buy it, illustrating the point that people's desires do not change, but their ability to fulfill those desires can.

Throughout the conversation, Maciej Stefaniak emphasizes the importance of having more wisdom in society and making smarter decisions. He invites listeners to tune in next week for another conversation.

The transcript is from an interview with Krzysztof Strauchman at Astronarium.pl, which also has a Facebook page and is available on other radio stations in Głuchołazy and the surrounding area.
