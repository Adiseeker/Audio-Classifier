In this conversation from a Polish radio program, Mariusz Stefaniak discusses the current state of entrepreneurship in Poland and its global context. He points out that despite being a leader in entrepreneurship on a global scale, with 78% of Poles believing that running one's own business is a good idea, the data also shows some disturbing trends.

1. **Business Closure Rate**: Almost every third entrepreneur thinks about closing their company, while every second one looks for a job. This suggests a high rate of entrepreneurship failure in Poland.

2. **Entrepreneurial Will and Respect**: Despite Poles' positive views on entrepreneurship, there's a drop in the number of people wanting to start new businesses compared to other European countries, with only 6% of Poles planning to start a business in the next three years â€” significantly lower than the average European figure.

3. **Entrepreneurial Numbers**: Poland has more mature companies (about 13%) than its peers but falls below the average when it comes to young and new businesses, indicating that successful businesses are often reluctant to give birth to new ones due to their financial stability.

4. **Global Business Complexity Index**: Poland is ranked second in Europe and tenth globally among countries with the most complex business rules, making it difficult for entrepreneurs to operate.

5. **National Index of Entrepreneurship Conditions**: Poland is at the bottom (15th place out of 22) when considering conditions that encourage entrepreneurship, ranking lower than both Romania and Bulgaria but higher than Belarus, indicating a range of challenges.

6. **Media Impact**: The mention of the media's role in affecting public perception of entrepreneurs, with a drop from positive reports in 2016 to negative ones in 2019, suggesting that such external factors could influence entrepreneurial endeavors.

Mariusz Stefaniak attributes these issues largely to the complexity and difficulty of doing business in Poland compared to other countries like Switzerland, where governments support their companies by offering favorable conditions. Key points include:

- **Taxation**: A significant difference in corporate income tax (CIT) rates between Poland (0.004%) and Switzerland (19%), suggesting that favorable business environments can lead to a higher rate of entrepreneurship.

This analysis highlights the challenges faced by Polish entrepreneurs, including high failure rates, limited support for new businesses, and complex regulatory environments compared to other countries like Switzerland.
