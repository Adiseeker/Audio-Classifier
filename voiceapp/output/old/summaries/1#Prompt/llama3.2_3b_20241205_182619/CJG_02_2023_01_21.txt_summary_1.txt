The text appears to be a transcript of a podcast or radio show discussing the state of mass culture, particularly in the film industry, where large companies are having a significant impact on the market. The host, Krzysztof Strauchman, is discussing how these companies are buying out critics and rating platforms, which has led to a decline in the quality of films being produced.

He cites examples such as "Rings of Power" from Tolkien's world, which was expected to be a huge success but ended up being a commercial failure due to its poor reception. He also mentions the case of Sapkowski's "Wied≈∫min", which was adapted into a popular TV series but was later destroyed by the producers in favor of a more commercial direction.

The host suggests that this is not just a coincidence, but rather a deliberate attempt by these companies to suppress original ideas and replace them with more market-friendly content. He implies that this has led to a decline in the quality of films being produced and has alienated fans who were once enthusiastic about these franchises.

The host also mentions that there is a growing movement among fans and critics who are pushing back against this trend, but notes that it is still an uphill battle.

Overall, the tone of the conversation is critical and satirical, with the host mocking the excesses of the film industry and the ways in which large companies are attempting to control the market.
