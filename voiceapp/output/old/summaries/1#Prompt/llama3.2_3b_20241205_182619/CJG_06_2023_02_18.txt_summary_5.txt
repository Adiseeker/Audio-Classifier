This text appears to be a transcript of a radio conversation between the host and Mariusz Stefania, the President of the Foundation "More Wisdom", discussing various economic and environmental issues related to Poland's economy and its reliance on fossil fuels.

Mariusz Stefania expresses concern about Poland's economic system, which he believes is based on exploiting cheap energy sources, particularly fossil fuels. He argues that this approach leads to high costs for consumers, including citizens, who have to pay exorbitant prices for energy due to the high cost of extraction and transportation from abroad.

He also highlights health issues related to air pollution caused by industrial activities, particularly in Poland, where an estimated 50,000 people die every year due to respiratory problems caused by suspended dust. Additionally, he mentions the significant amount of waste generated by international trade, particularly illegal dumping of garbage, which is often burned and releases toxic substances into the air.

Mariusz Stefania also criticizes the Polish government's policy of not prioritizing renewable energy sources, despite their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs in sustainable industries. He notes that Poland relies heavily on fossil fuels from countries like China and the USA, which are major polluters themselves.

The conversation touches on themes such as environmental degradation, economic instability, and social consequences, including rising poverty and depression rates among citizens. Mariusz Stefania argues that these issues will have severe consequences for future generations unless urgent action is taken to transition to cleaner energy sources and reduce pollution.

Overall, the transcript reveals concerns about Poland's economic and environmental policies, highlighting the need for sustainable development and a shift towards renewable energy sources to protect public health and ensure a better future for citizens.
