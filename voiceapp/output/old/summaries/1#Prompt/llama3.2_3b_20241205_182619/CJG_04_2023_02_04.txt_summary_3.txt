This is a transcript of an interview or conversation between Maciej Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert, and Krzysztof Strauchman. The topic of discussion appears to be the current state of personal finance, lending practices, and economic understanding among individuals.

Maciej Stefaniak makes several key points:

1. Giving 10 million in cash is a small fraction of what people will earn on it, suggesting that many people are not making informed financial decisions.
2. Politicians, rulers, and officials often have undue influence over financial regulations, which can lead to unfair advantages for certain groups.
3. Credit loans can require long periods of time (20-30 years) and imply a level of faith in the future, which some people may not possess.
4. The decline in lending practices from banks suggests that people are no longer taking out loans due to lack of trust or confidence in their ability to repay.
5. This decline is not necessarily due to increased intelligence or economic awareness among individuals, but rather a lack of access to credit.

Maciej Stefaniak uses an analogy of an alcoholic who cannot buy vodka because they don't have the money, to illustrate that people's financial decisions are often driven by their current circumstances, rather than any inherent change in their behavior or intelligence.

The conversation concludes with Maciej Stefaniak expressing his desire to promote wisdom and informed decision-making among individuals through initiatives like the "Foundation for more wisdom" and inviting listeners to tune in next week.
