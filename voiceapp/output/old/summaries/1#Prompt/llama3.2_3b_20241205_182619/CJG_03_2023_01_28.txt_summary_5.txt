This is not a discussion about Peter Jackson's movie or The Lord of the Rings, but rather a conversation between two individuals discussing the film industry, specifically about the role of ideology and politics in filmmaking.

The speaker, Mariusz Stefaniak, suggests that in modern society, it has become common to expect certain demographics (such as racial or ethnic groups) to be represented in films, with specific percentages being implied. He argues that this expectation is driven by political ideology rather than artistic merit.

Stefaniak believes that this approach leads to a focus on "diversity" over quality, resulting in poorly made films that are nevertheless funded due to their perceived ideological credentials. He implies that audiences who dislike these films are often labeled as "racist" or other terms of abuse, stifling free speech and artistic criticism.

The conversation highlights the tension between artistic freedom and political correctness, with Stefaniak advocating for a return to more traditional criteria for evaluating art, such as quality of acting, writing, and direction.
