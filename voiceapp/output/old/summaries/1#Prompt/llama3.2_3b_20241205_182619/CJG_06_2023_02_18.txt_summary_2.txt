This appears to be a transcript of a radio interview between the host and Mariusz Stefania, the President of the Foundation "More Wisdom" in Poland. The conversation revolves around various issues, including:

1. Economic concerns: Mariusz expresses his fear about the Polish economy being heavily dependent on fossil fuels, which he believes is unsustainable and will lead to negative consequences.
2. Health issues: He highlights the dangers of air pollution caused by industrial activities, particularly those related to coal burning, which results in significant mortality rates (estimated 50,000 deaths per year).
3. Foreign influence and corruption: Mariusz accuses Poland of being a "trashcan" for foreign garbage, particularly China's waste imports, which cause environmental harm.
4. Global pollution: He emphasizes that China and the USA are responsible for about 90% of global pollution, while Poland's economy is heavily reliant on them.

The tone of the conversation is critical and alarming, with Mariusz expressing his concerns about the future of Poland's economy and environment. The interview raises questions about the long-term sustainability of Poland's economic model and the need to address environmental issues and corruption.

Some key points from the transcript include:
