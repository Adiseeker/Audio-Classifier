This text appears to be a transcript of an interview with Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation, discussing the film industry and the controversy surrounding the representation of diverse groups in movies.

The conversation revolves around the release of the Amazon Prime series "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power," which received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and audiences. Stefaniak attributes the poor reception to the show's diversity, particularly the inclusion of black actors playing elves and transgender characters.

Stefaniak argues that the focus on representation and diversity in films has become a major factor in determining their success or failure. He believes that if certain groups are not included in a film, it will not be funded, even if those groups do not bring any additional value to the story.

The interviewer also mentions that some viewers were paid to watch the show due to its poor reception, highlighting the extreme measures taken by Amazon to promote the series.

Throughout the conversation, Stefaniak emphasizes his support for diversity and inclusion in films, but also expresses frustration with the current state of the industry.
