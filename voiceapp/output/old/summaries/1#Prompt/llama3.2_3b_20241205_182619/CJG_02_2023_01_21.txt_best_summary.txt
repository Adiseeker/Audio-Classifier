It seems like you're trying to share an interview with Mariusz Stefaniak discussing a significant trend among billionaires and tech companies. However, it appears that the text is cut off, and I can't provide a complete response.

However, based on the provided snippet, it seems like Mariusz Stefaniak is pointing out that the sudden decline in value of certain tech companies' shares, despite being giants in their respective industries, might be indicative of a larger crisis. He suggests that factors such as China's influence over these companies, lack of control, and global economic uncertainty could be contributing to this phenomenon.

Stefaniak also mentions the importance of understanding the demand for products and services in real-time market conditions, rather than relying on traditional valuation methods. He uses the example of Coca-Cola, where the value of a bottle is determined by consumer demand, highlighting the psychological aspect of prices.

It's worth noting that Mariusz Stefaniak seems to be signaling that there is a larger crisis brewing, which has been ignored or downplayed by some sources. The fact that indicators across various industries are falling and tech giants' shares are declining might suggest that this is indeed a sign of a broader economic issue.

If you could provide the rest of the text, I would be happy to help you better understand Mariusz Stefaniak's arguments and insights on this topic.
