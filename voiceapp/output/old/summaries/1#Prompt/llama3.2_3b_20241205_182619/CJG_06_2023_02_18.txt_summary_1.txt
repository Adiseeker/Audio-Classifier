This appears to be a transcript of a radio conversation between the host and a guest, Mariusz Stefania, who is the President of the Foundation "More Wisdom". The conversation revolves around various topics related to Poland's economy and environment.

Mariusz expresses concerns about Poland's dependence on fossil fuels, which he believes is hurting the country's economy. He mentions that the Polish government prioritizes cheap energy over other factors, such as ideology and morality. He also discusses air pollution caused by illegal waste dumping from other countries, particularly China.

One of Mariusz's main points is that the world's two biggest polluters are China and the USA, responsible for about 90% of global pollution. However, Poland has a business relationship with these countries, which leads to economic development at the expense of its own environment.

Mariusz also mentions the impact on public health due to poor air quality, stating that up to 50,000 people in Poland die every year from diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust.

He warns that if this situation continues, it could lead to a powerful crisis that could result in the death of many people, including mass suicides due to bankruptcy and lack of hope.

The conversation ends with an invitation for listeners to return next week for another installment.

Some key takeaways from the conversation:

1. Poland's economy is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which is negatively impacting the environment.
2. The country prioritizes cheap energy over other factors, contributing to environmental degradation.
3. China and the USA are the world's biggest polluters, responsible for about 90% of global pollution.
4. Poland has a business relationship with these countries, despite their negative environmental impact.
5. Air pollution is having devastating effects on public health in Poland.

Overall, Mariusz's concerns highlight the need for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious approach to economic development in Poland.
