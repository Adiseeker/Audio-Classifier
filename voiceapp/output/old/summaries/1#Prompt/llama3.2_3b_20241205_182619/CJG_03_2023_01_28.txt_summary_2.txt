This text appears to be a transcript of an interview between a host (Krzysztof Strauchman) and a guest (Mariusz Stefaniak), a president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation, a financial expert, and an economist.

The conversation revolves around the movie "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power," specifically its reception among viewers and critics. Mariusz Stefaniak expresses concerns about the production's reliance on diversity and representation quotas, suggesting that this approach can lead to poorly cast actors being forced into roles simply because they fit a certain demographic.

He criticizes the practice of paying viewers to watch episodes, citing it as an unprecedented measure in the film industry. He also mentions that some viewers are being labeled racist or bigoted for expressing dissatisfaction with the show's content.

Throughout the conversation, Stefaniak emphasizes his commitment to fairness and meritocracy, suggesting that actors should be chosen based on their talent and suitability for a role, rather than their identity or alignment with certain ideologies.

The interview concludes with thanks to Mariusz Stefaniak and an announcement of the next episode of "Inne Radio".
