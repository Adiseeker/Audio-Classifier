This text appears to be a transcript of an interview or conversation between Maciej Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert, and Krzysztof Strauchman. The topic of discussion seems to revolve around the state of economic knowledge and decision-making in society.

Maciej Stefaniak presents several points:

1. Giving 10 million dollars in cash is a small fraction of what individuals would earn over time if they were given such an opportunity.
2. Politicians, rulers, and officials often have more influence than ordinary people due to their power and wealth, which can lead to regulations being created for them rather than the general population.
3. Credit often requires faith in the future and the ability to repay loans, which can indicate a lack of trust in the economy.

He suggests that this lack of faith is not necessarily due to people losing confidence in the future, but rather because banks are becoming more cautious about lending money. If banks were to change their stance and offer preferential loans, people would be more likely to take them up.

Maciej Stefaniak uses analogies, such as an alcoholic who can't afford vodka being just as inclined to buy it if they could access the funds, to illustrate his points.

The conversation also touches on the importance of increasing wisdom in society and making smarter decisions.
