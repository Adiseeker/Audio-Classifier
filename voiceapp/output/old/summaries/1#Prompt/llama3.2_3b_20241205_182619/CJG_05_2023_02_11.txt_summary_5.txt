This is a transcript of a radio broadcast discussing the current state of energy prices and coal imports in Poland, with a critical analysis of the government's decisions and their impact on the economy. The speaker, Krzysztof Strauchman, presents various points to argue that the recent surge in energy prices is not solely due to the war in Ukraine, but rather a result of deliberate policy decisions made by politicians.

The guest, Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financier, provides insight into how financial sanctions against Russia are ineffective, as Russian banks can still operate through non-sanctioned banks. He also notes that Poland's decision to stop importing coal from Russia has led to a tenfold increase in prices.

Some key points made by Krzysztof Strauchman include:

1. The sudden closure of Polish coal mines and the subsequent ban on importing coal from Russia are not related to the war in Ukraine.
2. Financial sanctions against Russia have not worked, as Russian banks continue to operate through non-sanctioned channels.
3. Poland's decision to stop importing coal has led to a significant increase in prices, making it unaffordable for many households.
4. The government's actions are causing economic hardship, with massive bankruptcies of Polish companies and a significant decline in consumer spending.

Mariusz Stefaniak's responses to Krzysztof Strauchman's arguments include:

1. Acknowledging that the war in Ukraine has contributed to energy price increases, but emphasizing that it is not the sole cause.
2. Highlighting the effectiveness of financial sanctions against Russia, despite their perceived ineffectiveness.
3. Supporting the idea that Poland's decision to stop importing coal from Russia has led to a surge in prices.

The conversation concludes with Krzysztof Strauchman thanking Mariusz Stefaniak for his insights and looking forward to discussing other topics related to energy prices and coal imports.
