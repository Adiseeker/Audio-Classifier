This appears to be a transcript of an audio interview or podcast episode from a Polish radio station called "Inne Radio". The speaker, Mariusz Stefaniak, is an economist and financial expert who has appeared on the show.

During the conversation, Stefaniak shares his experiences working in business, finance, and politics, which has given him a unique perspective on the world. He notes that many people's views on politics and economics are influenced by their personal connections with powerful individuals, rather than objective facts.

Stefaniak also mentions the importance of understanding the financial aspects of various issues, such as wars, crises, and economic trends. He suggests that following the path of money can be a useful way to gain insight into complex problems.

The episode concludes with a brief poem summarizing the main points, and an invitation for listeners to tune in again next week. The host, Krzysztof Strauchman, thanks Mariusz Stefaniak for his insights and promises to explore more "hidden matters" on future episodes.
