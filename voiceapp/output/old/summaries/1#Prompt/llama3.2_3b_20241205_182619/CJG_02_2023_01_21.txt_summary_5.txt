This text appears to be a transcript of a radio show discussion about the current state of the entertainment industry, specifically the film and book industries. The host, Krzysztof Strauchman, is discussing how big companies are exerting significant influence over the industry, including buying out critics, studios, and even entire markets.

He cites examples such as Amazon's acquisition of "The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power" series, which received overwhelmingly positive reviews from mainstream media but was criticized by fans and independent experts for its perceived lack of authenticity. He also mentions the case of Sapkowski's "Wied≈∫min" (a Polish fantasy series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's books), which was adapted into a popular Netflix series but was later panned by critics and fans alike.

The host suggests that this trend is not unique to these specific examples, but rather indicative of a broader problem in the industry where big companies are prioritizing profit over artistic merit. He implies that this has led to a decline in the quality of productions and a loss of trust among fans.

Throughout the discussion, the host uses analogies from everyday life, such as comparing a car purchase to buying a movie or book series, to illustrate his points. He also mentions the economic implications of this trend, suggesting that it is having a negative impact on the market.

The final section of the transcript invites listeners to tune in to the next meeting, where economist Mariusz Stefaniak will discuss the topic further.
