The topic of discussion revolves around the analysis of the financial performance of various film productions and their relation to the success or failure of these projects. The speaker emphasizes that the film industry is distinct from other sectors in terms of its impact on society, as it can shape people's minds and influence life decisions.

In examining the case of Amazon's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, which was a critical and commercial success, earning over $300-380 million per part, and the first film of "Fellowship of the Ring," which earned approximately 377 million dollars. The speaker also discusses how "The Hobbit," although smaller in terms of production budget, still managed to earn an average of 250 million dollars per part.

In contrast, Amazon's recent series "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" was initially expected to be a massive hit and boast significant profits but has not yet provided substantial evidence of its financial success. A comparison with other successful productions like "The Witcher," "Star Wars," "Maverick," and "Avatar" highlights the common factor of ideology in these films' successes or failures.

It seems that the speaker believes that ideology is a crucial determinant in predicting the success or failure of film productions, which can be attributed to their influence on audience perception and societal values. However, this topic requires further exploration and analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding.

The speaker suggests that it might be beneficial to delve into the specific ideologies present in these films and their impact on audiences and society as a whole. This could involve examining the cultural context in which these films were produced and released, as well as the messages they convey about power, morality, and societal norms.

In conclusion, while the speaker highlights the differences between the film industry and other sectors, it is clear that ideology plays a significant role in shaping the success or failure of film productions. A deeper analysis of this topic could provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics at play in the entertainment industry and its impact on society.
