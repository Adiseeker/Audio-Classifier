This is a transcript of a radio show discussion about the state of mass culture, particularly in relation to the entertainment industry. The host, Krzysztof Strauchman, appears to be critical of the current state of affairs, where big companies are exerting significant influence over what is considered "good" or "successful" content.

Specifically, he mentions two examples:

1. The Amazon Studios production of "Rings of Power," which was expected to be a monumental success but instead received negative reviews from critics and audiences alike. This led to a financial loss for the company.
2. The destruction of the Polish gaming studio's "Wied≈∫min" series, which was adapted into a TV show by a powerful company. The fans were upset with the changes made to the original material, leading to a backlash against the creators.

The host suggests that these examples are indicative of a larger problem in the industry, where big companies are buying and manipulating critics and reviews to promote their own interests. He implies that this leads to a homogenization of taste and a suppression of independent voices.

Throughout the conversation, the tone is critical and sarcastic, with the host using analogies (e.g., "like buying a Skoda car") to illustrate his points. The discussion also touches on the broader economic implications of this phenomenon, including the impact on the market and the wider cultural landscape.

The final section invites listeners to tune in for future discussions on the topic, featuring economist Mariusz Stefaniak as a guest speaker.
