The speaker, Mariusz Stefaniak, is criticizing the economic policies of his government regarding coal imports from Russia. He argues that the current high prices for coal are not due to market forces or a response to a war, but rather to political decisions and sanctions.

Stefaniak claims that the sanctions against Russia have had little effect, as Russian banks continue to function normally and transactions continue through Chinese banks. He also points out that Polish companies are still buying coal from Russia at high prices, despite the media hype about sanctions.

He criticizes the decision to close most of Poland's coal mines, which has led to a significant increase in prices for coal. He argues that this decision was motivated by political considerations rather than economic ones, and that it is unfair to penalize Polish consumers with such high prices.

Stefaniak also shares a personal anecdote about a woman who works at a cleaning company and struggles to afford coal for her heating. He emphasizes the human cost of these policies and argues that they are causing hardship for ordinary people.

Throughout the conversation, Stefaniak expresses frustration and disappointment with the government's economic decisions, which he believes are driven by politics rather than economics.
