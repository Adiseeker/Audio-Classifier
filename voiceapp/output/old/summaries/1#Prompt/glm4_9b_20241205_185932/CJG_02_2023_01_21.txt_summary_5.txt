Your description touches upon several key points regarding the current state of the cinema industry, including how big budgets do not always guarantee success, issues with media representation, and the potential impact on culture and economy. Here's a breakdown of these points:

1. **Big Budgets Don't Always Equal Success**: You mentioned the example of "Rings of Power" from Tolkien's world, which was expected to be a major hit given its investment of nearly $1 billion. However, it did not meet the expectations and was considered a financial loss by many.

2. **Media Representation and Manipulation**: The situation with "Rings of Power" also highlighted how media can sometimes misrepresent public opinion or even create an illusion of success through paid reviews and rankings, which you described as "buying" critics and ranking systems.

3. **Public Discontent and Decline in Market**: The lack of success for high-budget projects has led to a wave of similar situations where fans and independent experts express dissatisfaction with the results of big investments. This discontent has contributed to a general decline in the market, as you suggested.

4. **Impact on Cultural and Economic Sectors**: High-profile failures have significant implications not only in terms of financial loss but also culturally. For instance, Sapkowski's "Wiedźmin" series was a cultural achievement for Poland, and its adaptation into a film series led to a scandal that damaged the original work's integrity.

5. **Attitude Towards Consumers**: The attitude expressed by those involved in these high-profile failures is concerning, as it seems to prioritize profits over quality and viewer satisfaction. This may lead to consumer skepticism and a further decline in market confidence.

6. **Next Discussion Topic**: You mentioned that you will discuss the broader implications of what's happening in mass culture during an upcoming meeting, which suggests that this topic is significant enough to warrant a more in-depth analysis.

7. **Radio Broadcasts**: The radio station, Tronko.pl, and other stations in Głuchołazy and the area are involved in discussing these issues, which indicates that there is an ongoing conversation about the state of mass culture and its effects on society.

In summary, your narrative covers critical issues such as the financial risks of high-budget cinema, media integrity, public dissatisfaction with big budgets, cultural damage from failed adaptations, and the broader economic and cultural impact of these trends. It's clear that there is a desire to engage in a conversation about these issues and how they might shape the future of mass culture and entertainment.
