The audio you've shared seems like an excerpt from a conversation or debate involving Mariusz Stefaniak, who is a financial expert and economist. He discusses the topic of coal prices, especially in Poland, which have soared due to various factors such as changes in global supply chain dynamics due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and also touches upon geopolitical considerations.

Here's a summary of his points:

1. **Coal Price Increase**: Mariusz points out that despite no significant increase in mining costs in Poland, coal prices have increased from around 350 zlotys per ton to 2,000 zlotys due to the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Government support has even pushed the total cost up to 3,500 zlotys.

2. **Reasons for the Increase**: He argues that the primary reason is not an increase in mining costs but rather the shift from importing coal from Russia (a reliable supplier with high-quality coal) to other sources. 

3. **Sanctions and Ethics**: Mariusz is critical of the decision to stop importing coal from Russia as part of sanctions against the country, suggesting it was driven by a desire for ethics rather than practical considerations. He questions this stance considering Poland's trade relations with China, which he considers a less ethical regime.

4. **China and Global Trade**: He expresses concern about continuing to import energy from China while maintaining an anti-Russia stance. He notes that China is aggressive towards neighboring countries and has been involved in military conflict for many years. Additionally, China is openly discussing the annexation of Taiwan.

5. **Economic Considerations**: Mariusz emphasizes the importance of planning and a thoughtful approach to economic decisions. He questions the wisdom of cutting off trade with Russia abruptly, noting that such actions could lead to further economic difficulties due to a lack of alternative suppliers in the short term.

6. **Diplomatic and Trade Dynamics**: He discusses the reality that despite declarations of war or sanctions, many countries are still trading with Russia, suggesting that these decisions might not always be as clear-cut as they seem.

In summary, Mariusz Stefaniak's perspective focuses on the economic and geopolitical implications of coal price increases due to political decisions, suggesting a complex relationship between ethics, trade, and practicality.
