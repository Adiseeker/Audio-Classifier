This conversation appears to be from a radio broadcast where an economist, Mariusz Stefaniak, is discussing economic issues with the host, Krzysztof Strauchman. The main topics of concern are:

1. **Minimum Wage, Maximum Price, and Indicators**: Mariusz mentions that indicators such as minimum wage and maximum price suggest something is wrong in the economy because they indicate a deviation from free market rules.

2. **Free Market Economy Comparison**: He suggests that in a true free market economy, like the historical American one, there would be no such regulations. Fuel prices, particularly, are mentioned as being too high and not reflective of economic reality.

3. **Fuel and Energy Prices**: The conversation discusses the impact of government revenue from fuel and excise taxes, which have increased due to high prices caused by events like the war in Ukraine. Mariusz emphasizes that it is a political decision rather than a consequence of the war that has led to these high prices.

4. **Sanctions on Russia**: He expresses skepticism about the effectiveness of financial sanctions against Russia, noting that Russian banks continue to operate and significant transactions are still taking place.

5. **Impact of Sanctions**: According to Mariusz, the sanctions have not worked as intended and have instead caused economic hardship in Poland, including bankruptcy of companies and a decrease in shop turnover by 50%.

6. **Coal Price Increase**: He attributes the rise in coal prices to political decisions rather than market dynamics and laments the closing of Polish coal mines which had kept prices low before.

7. **Comparative Coal Prices**: Mariusz points out that while coal from Poland used to cost between 300-400 zlotys per ton, it now costs 2000-2500 zlotys due to political decisions and sanctions against Russia.

The host concludes the conversation by thanking Mariusz for his insights and indicates a shift to another topic on the radio broadcast.
