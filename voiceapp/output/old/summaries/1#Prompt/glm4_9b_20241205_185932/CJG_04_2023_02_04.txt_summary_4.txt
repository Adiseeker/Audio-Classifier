Your description encapsulates several key economic concepts, each contributing to a broader understanding of financial markets, credit, and societal behavior. Here's an analysis based on your statement:

1. **The Role of Money in Influence**: You suggest that large sums of money, like 10 million euros, are a fraction of what the recipients might earn on it, indicating the potential for influence over politicians and officials through financial donations or investments. This underscores the idea that wealth can be a powerful tool in shaping policy and regulations.

2. **The Powerlessness of Individuals**: The statement implies that ordinary people have little to no ability to influence political decisions, while "giants" (large corporations or wealthy individuals) can. This reflects a broader economic principle where power is concentrated among the few, leading to regulations and policies often favoring these entities.

3. **Credit and Faith in the Future**: The mention of taking credit over 20-30 years suggests long-term financial commitments that require faith in one's ability to pay off the debt and earn enough to do so. This concept points to the economic optimism necessary for such extended loans, as well as the risks involved when this optimism wanes.

4. **Lack of Wisdom and Economic Knowledge**: You argue that the decision not to take on loans does not necessarily mean a loss of faith in the future but rather reflects banks' reluctance to lend due to the perceived wisdom or lack thereof among potential borrowers. This implies that financial institutions are not as optimistic about the future economic prospects as they were before.

5. **Comparing to an Alcoholic**: Your comparison of someone who cannot buy vodka (due to unavailability or lack of funds) to an alcoholic who stops drinking is a metaphor for suggesting that the change in behavior (not taking loans) is not due to increased wisdom but rather due to external constraints.

6. **The Purpose of the Audition**: The mention of "more wisdom in society and making smarter decisions" implies a call for better financial literacy and responsible economic behaviors among the population.

7. **Conclusion and Invitation**: You thank the audience for their attention and invite them to future conversations, indicating the importance of ongoing discussions about economic issues.

Overall, your statement touches on themes related to wealth distribution, the role of finance in society, economic optimism versus pessimism, and the need for financial education. The invitation to further discussion reflects a desire to promote a more informed and responsible approach to economics among individuals and institutions alike.
