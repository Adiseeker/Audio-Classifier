This text appears to be an excerpt from a radio program or public hearing, likely related to environmental concerns and economic issues within Poland. The speaker is expressing deep concern about several critical matters:

1. **Environmental Damage**: The speaker is particularly worried about air pollution, caused by the use of fossil fuels, especially coal. This includes health risks due to high levels of suspended dust, which can lead to serious health problems such as death from diseases.

2. **Economic Consequences**: There is a concern about the increasing cost of energy, specifically coal, which directly impacts economic development and potentially leads to inflationary pressures that could result in hunger and financial strain for citizens.

3. **Environmental Offloading**: The speaker discusses how Poland may be accepting pollution from other countries due to its reliance on fossil fuels and illegal disposal of waste. This not only causes significant air pollution but also profits individuals involved in the waste trade.

4. **Global Responsibility**: The speaker points out that while Poland struggles with environmental issues, larger countries such as China and the USA are responsible for a large portion of global pollution, yet Poland remains tied to economic relationships with them.

5. **Health Issues**: There's an emphasis on health problems associated with pollution, including respiratory diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust in Polish cities.

6. **Mental Health**: The speaker mentions the psychological impact of the pandemic and economic struggles, suggesting that it can lead to depression and even mass suicides due to bankruptcy and financial stress.

7. **Upcoming Event**: The text concludes with an invitation to a future public hearing or radio show where these issues will be discussed further.

The excerpt is emotional and passionate, reflecting the urgency of the speaker's concerns about environmental degradation and economic challenges within Poland. It also shows a desire for change and increased awareness among listeners about the consequences of current policies and practices.
