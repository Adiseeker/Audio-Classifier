This passage appears to be an excerpt from a radio broadcast or public hearing, possibly part of a series on environmental and economic issues in Poland. The speaker raises concerns about multiple topics:

1. **Economic Development and Fossil Fuels**: The speaker criticizes what they perceive as policies that prioritize the extraction and use of fossil fuels over the health of the economy and environment.

2. **Energy Costs**: The speaker expresses concern about energy costs, suggesting that efforts are being made to make energy more expensive, which could negatively impact Poland's economic development.

3. **Environmental Health**: There is a focus on the health impacts of air pollution, particularly related to diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust and the stench of low emissions.

4. **Illegal Waste Importation**: The speaker suggests that Poland is used as a dump site for illegal waste from other countries, which contributes to significant environmental harm and toxic air pollution.

5. **Pollution and Responsibility**: The discussion also touches on the role of China and the United States in global pollution and the speaker's belief that these two nations are not taking sufficient steps to reduce their impact on the environment.

6. **Social and Economic Consequences**: The speaker expresses fears about the social and economic consequences of continued reliance on fossil fuels, including potential widespread hunger and bankruptcy, which could lead to severe psychological stress and even mass suicides.

7. **Public Awareness and Media Representation**: There is a call for increased awareness of these issues among the public and a concern that media coverage may be insufficient or not prominently displayed in newspapers.

The speaker concludes by inviting a guest, Mariusz Stefania, President of the Foundation "More Wisdom," to discuss these matters further during future broadcasts. The passage reflects an engaged and concerned perspective on environmental policy and economic sustainability.
