It sounds like you are discussing a number of economic themes, particularly regarding credit and its relation to trust, knowledge, and societal wisdom. Here's an interpretation of the points made:

1. **The Impact of Wealth on Influence**: You're noting that a large sum of money, such as 10 million, is not as significant in terms of influence as what can be earned from it over time. This implies that the real power lies with those who control or can generate substantial earnings, rather than with the cash itself.

2. **The Role of Politicians and Officials**: You suggest that the regulations are targeted towards giants or individuals with significant wealth and influence since they have the capacity to affect politics and policy-making.

3. **Credit and Long-Term Faith in the Future**: The mention of 20-30 year loans reflects a belief that credit is often taken based on expectations of future earnings and repayment ability. You argue that the reluctance to take these loans doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of faith in the future but could be because banks are reluctant to lend.

4. **The Role of Banks**: You mention that if banks were to offer super preferential loans, there would be a queue to take them. This highlights the power of financial institutions and their role in determining what is possible or not.

5. **Public Perception vs Reality**: You argue that people may appear to lack wisdom or economic knowledge, but this is not necessarily true. Instead, it could be due to banks not providing loans, which is an external factor rather than a change in public behavior.

6. **The Importance of Wisdom**: The mention of the "Foundation for more wisdom" and the need for smarter decisions suggests that you believe that societal understanding and wisdom are crucial to making better economic choices.

7. **Alcoholism as a Metaphor**: You use an analogy with alcoholism, suggesting that someone who stops drinking due to lack of access or money is not necessarily wiser but just lacks the opportunity to indulge.

8. **The Purpose of the Talk**: The conversation you've described seems to be part of an educational effort to promote wisdom and better decision-making in society.

In conclusion, you seem to be advocating for a greater understanding of economic systems and the role that banks and wealth play within them. You're emphasizing the importance of not just having money or access to credit but also of using one's wisdom to make smart decisions that benefit both individuals and society as a whole.
