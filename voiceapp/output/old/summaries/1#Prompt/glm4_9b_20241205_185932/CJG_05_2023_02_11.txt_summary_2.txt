This conversation appears to be a segment from a radio broadcast where an economist named Mariusz Stefaniak is discussing economic issues with a host, Krzysztof Strauchman. The following points were made during their conversation:

1. **Market Regulations**: Mariusz expresses concern that the economy is not operating under healthy market rules due to indicators such as minimum wage and maximum price controls.

2. **Free Market Economy**: He contrasts this situation with the supposed free-market system in the United States, arguing that a true free market does not involve such regulations.

3. **Fuel Prices**: The conversation covers fuel prices, which Mariusz claims are absurdly high and do not reflect economic reality, suggesting that states didn't profit from low fuel prices.

4. **Government Revenue**: The host points out that the government earns money from fuel taxes, including excise tax on cotton wool. Mariusz acknowledges this but argues it doesn't make sense for prices to be as high as they are.

5. **War in Ukraine**: Mariusz suggests that skyrocketing prices are not due to war, despite the conflict in Ukraine. He claims that a lack of coal imports from Russia is causing shortages and price increases, which he attributes to political decisions rather than war.

6. **Sanctions on Russia**: The conversation touches upon economic sanctions against Russia, with the host suggesting that they are not effective. Mariusz agrees, stating that many Russian banks continue to operate normally and that large transactions are being conducted through Chinese banks.

7. **Impact of Sanctions**: He criticizes the sanctions' impact on Poland, suggesting they have caused massive bankruptcies and reduced spending in shops, particularly with high energy costs for households.

8. **Coal Imports**: Mariusz laments Poland's decision to stop importing coal from Russia, which he believes has exacerbated the energy crisis by causing prices to skyrocket due to domestic supply issues.

9. **Comparison of Coal Prices**: He notes the dramatic increase in coal prices in Poland, comparing it to previous prices before the crisis.

10. **Conclusion**: The segment ends with a discussion on the political decisions regarding Russia and coal imports without adequate solutions or alternative supplies.

This exchange highlights the host's and economist's differing views on economic policy and its impact on Poland's economy, particularly concerning energy costs and international relations.
