topic for discussion.

Let's continue with the points raised:

1. **Real Estate Market Crisis**: Mr. Mariusz is suggesting that the Polish real estate market is experiencing a crisis due to a significant decrease in housing loans taken by Poles. He also points out that despite this drop in loan activity, there hasn't been a proportional decrease in housing prices, which he predicted would occur.

2. **Housing Prices and Rent**: The data shows that both flat prices and rental rates are falling. Mr. Mariusz attributes the recent increase in rental rates to previous growth due to the influx of Ukrainian refugees but suggests that now these rates are stabilizing or even decreasing.

3. **Government Policies**: The government is considering imposing additional fees on companies buying flats in bulk, which might be an attempt to regulate the market. However, Mr. Mariusz doubts the effectiveness of such policies and suggests that the government's focus should not be solely on lowering housing prices but on addressing the systemic issues that are affecting the economy.

4. **Inflation vs. Market Health**: Mr. Mariusz argues that inflation is not a primary cause of the current situation in the real estate market, suggesting instead that there are deeper structural issues within the economy and the financial system that need to be addressed.

5. **Market Dynamics**: The economist emphasizes that the market dynamics have been significantly impacted by the large influx of Ukrainian refugees. This has led to an imbalance in the housing market, and while prices are falling, this may not be enough to stabilize or improve the situation given the scale of the problem.

6. **Long-term Solutions**: Mr. Mariusz suggests that any measures taken must address systemic issues rather than just being short-term fixes. He believes that a 300% decrease in prices might not be enough to halt what he sees as an impending crash in the real estate market.

In summary, the discussion highlights concerns about the state of Poland's real estate market, with Mr. Mariusz emphasizing the need for structural changes and systemic solutions rather than just focusing on price adjustments.
