The situation described in this text appears to be an analysis of the cinema industry's current state, particularly focusing on how big companies and their financial influence can sometimes overshadow creative efforts and viewer expectations. Here are some key points from the text:

1. **Losses for Big Studios**: In 2022, major studios started experiencing significant losses, with one film having a reported $200 million loss.

2. **High Investment in 'Rings of Power'**: Amazon Studio's investment of nearly a billion dollars in "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" was unprecedented and ended up being a huge financial failure.

3. **Manipulation of Opinions**: There is an implication that big companies, like Amazon, may have paid off critics or controlled movie ranking systems to present their products favorably, even though they were not well-received by ordinary viewers and independent experts.

4. **Contrast Between Expectation and Reality**: The text uses the metaphor of a car being promoted as "the best" but failing to live up to its cost and the anticipation of viewers.

5. **Example with 'Sapkowski and Wied≈∫min'**: Another example given is the adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski's book series "The Witcher," which was so poorly received that it resulted in a public uproar, leading to talent leaving the production.

6. **Insulting Viewers and Fans**: The text suggests that the industry often treats its viewers as naive or stupid, which has led to a decline in market reception for such products.

7. **General Decline in Market**: This trend of big companies overstepping their bounds is said to have caused a general decline in the entertainment market.

8. **Invitation to Discuss Further**: The text invites further discussion about this topic in the next meeting with Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financier, who is scheduled to appear on Saturday and Sunday at 10:30.

The tone of the text seems critical of the current state of the cinema industry and the influence of big money over creative content. It suggests that the audience's interests are sometimes overshadowed by corporate greed and manipulation.
