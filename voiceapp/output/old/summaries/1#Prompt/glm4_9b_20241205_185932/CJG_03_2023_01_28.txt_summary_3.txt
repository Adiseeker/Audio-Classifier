It sounds like you're summarizing a radio talk show or podcast episode where several topics related to film industry trends and criticism were discussed. Here's a breakdown of the key points covered in the conversation:

1. **High Ratings Controversy**: The hosts mention a movie with high ratings from critics and viewers, but suggest that the success may have been influenced by bought reviews and other manipulations within the film industry.

2. **Film Ratings Paradoxes**: There's a discussion about how Amazon had to buy viewers in some countries due to low engagement with the content, leading them to pay people to watch the movies just to improve their reception.

3. **Controversy Over Representation**: The hosts discuss the increasing presence of black actors and homosexuals in film roles, which they see as part of a broader ideological agenda rather than based on merit or talent.

4. **Quality vs. Ideology**: The hosts argue that there is a growing trend where studios are pressured to hire people for their political or ideological fit rather than their acting abilities. This situation is reminiscent of the past when political commissars had significant influence over productions regardless of their management capabilities.

5. **Fan Rebellion**: The conversation touches on how these practices have led to fan backlash, with viewers demanding better-quality shows and not just ideologically driven content.

6. **Closing Remarks**: The hosts thank Mariusz Stefaniak for his insights as the president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation, a financial expert and economist, who brought up the issues discussed during the show.

7. **Programming Information**: Finally, there's an invitation to tune in next week to "Inne Radio" for more discussions on similar topics, providing details about the frequency and location of the station.

This conversation highlights current concerns within the film industry regarding the intersection of politics, ratings, and content quality, and suggests a divide between those who value artistic merit over ideological representation.
