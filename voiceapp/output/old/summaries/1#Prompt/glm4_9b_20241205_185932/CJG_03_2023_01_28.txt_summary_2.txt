It appears that the text you've provided is a segment from an interview or a discussion on a radio show. The topic of conversation revolves around several issues within the film industry, including ratings manipulation, representation in films, and the perception of ideological interference.

Here's a breakdown of the key points discussed:

1. **Ratings Manipulation**: The segment mentions that there were claims of critics' reviews being bought to achieve higher ratings for a film. This is described as 'brutal' and refers to Amazon reportedly paying viewers in certain countries to watch movies, which had poor initial reception.

2. **Representation and Ideology in Film**: There's an argument made about the presence of black actors, homosexuals, or those playing homosexuals in films, emphasizing that it's no longer a surprise but is sometimes seen as a political statement rather than artistic choice. The concern expressed is that this representation may not always be due to talent but because of political quotas.

3. **Quality vs Ideology**: The discussion contrasts the demand for good quality shows with the perception of ideological propaganda in films. It suggests that viewers want quality content above all else and that being associated with a film's ideology can lead to criticism, including being labeled as racist or other pejorative terms.

4. **Fan Rebellion**: The conversation highlights the fan rebellion against what they perceive as poor-quality, propagandistic content over good shows, indicating a pushback against films that focus on political messages at the expense of storytelling and production quality.

The interviewee is Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation, who offers his perspectives on these issues. The interviewer, Krzysztof Strauchman, seems to be leading the conversation with questions about the industry's practices and the concerns of viewers and fans.

The segment concludes with a sign-off from the interviewee, followed by information about the radio program, "Inne Radio," which is advertising future broadcasts.
