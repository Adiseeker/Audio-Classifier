Thank you for sharing that detailed discussion. It sounds like a complex issue with significant implications for both the film industry and broader cultural trends. Let's break down some key points:

### Key Points Discussed:
1. **Economic Impact of Cinema Distribution:**
   - Big companies earn substantial wealth through ticket distribution, often in the hundreds of millions of dollars from single movies.
   
2. **2022 Breakthrough Year for Studios:**
   - Major film studios faced significant financial losses due to major productions, with one example cited as a loss of $200 million per movie.

3. **"The Rings of Power":**
   - A high-budget Amazon Prime production that was expected to be a massive hit but failed to meet expectations and caused backlash from both critics and audiences.
   
4. **Industry Practices:**
   - Use of influential opinions, paid critics, and bought-out review services to manage public perception.
   - These practices are described as absurd and indicative of the current state of the industry.

5. **Sapkowski and "Wied≈∫min":**
   - A well-known Polish brand whose adaptation into a series was poorly received by fans, leading to backlash against the studio involved.

6. **General Market Decline:**
   - The combination of these practices led to a general decline in the market for films and other media products.

### Implications:
1. **Consumer Trust Issues:**
   - Consumers are increasingly skeptical about industry claims and may be losing trust in reviews and marketing.
   
2. **Financial Risks for Studios:**
   - High-budget productions carry significant financial risks, especially when expectations aren't met.
   
3. **Cultural Impact:**
   - Major film adaptations can have a profound impact on cultural narratives and perceptions of brands.

4. **Economic and Cultural Disruption:**
   - The industry's practices may lead to economic downturns within the sector and broader cultural disruptions.

### Next Steps:
- Future discussions might explore how these trends are affecting other areas of mass culture, such as music or video games.
- Inviting economist Mariusz Stefaniak suggests a deeper dive into the financial and economic impacts of these phenomena.
