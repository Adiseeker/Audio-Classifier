Thank you for sharing this detailed discussion about the current state of cinema and entertainment industry, particularly focusing on some high-profile failures and controversies surrounding blockbuster productions.

To summarize and elaborate on your points:

1. **Cinema Network and Economic Impact**: The distribution of cinema tickets is a significant revenue generator for large companies, with even single movies generating hundreds of millions in earnings. This highlights the economic importance of cinema and entertainment in the global market.

2. **Breakthrough Year 2022**: The year marked a turning point where major film studios started experiencing significant financial losses on their biggest productions. For instance, "The Rings of Power" from Amazon Studios incurred losses of $200 million despite the massive investment of almost a billion dollars. This is unprecedented and represents a substantial shift in the industry.

3. **Criticism and Media Manipulation**: There was a stark contrast between the industry's claim of success and the negative feedback from ordinary viewers and independent experts. It appeared that powerful companies resorted to buying critics' opinions or manipulating media evaluations, which is a concerning trend within the entertainment sector.

4. **Impact on Fan Communities and Culture**: High-profile failures such as the "Rings of Power" and "Wied≈∫min" series had significant backlash from fan communities. This includes actors leaving projects in protest and fans expressing their dissatisfaction with the direction taken by these productions, which were seen as disrespectful to both original creators and audiences.

5. **General Market Decline**: The overall market was affected by this wave of failures and controversies, leading to a general decline in consumer interest and spending on cinema and entertainment products.

6. **Expert Insight Needed**: To better understand the current state of mass culture and its economic implications, there is a need for more analysis from experts like economist Mariusz Stefaniak, who can provide deeper insights into these trends and their broader impacts.
