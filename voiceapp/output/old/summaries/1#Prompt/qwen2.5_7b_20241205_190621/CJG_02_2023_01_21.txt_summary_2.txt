Thank you for sharing this detailed discussion on the state of cinema and mass culture. It sounds like there are significant issues impacting both the film industry and the broader cultural landscape, particularly with regard to how major studios operate and engage with audiences.

Here's a summary and some key points from your conversation:

1. **Economic Impact**: Large companies earn substantial profits through ticket sales and distribution of cinema films. A single blockbuster can generate hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in revenue.

2. **Financial Discrepancy in 2022**: Major productions faced unprecedented financial losses, with some studios losing up to $200 million from a single movie release. This was unexpected given the large investments made.

3. **Rings of Power Case Study**:
   - Amazon Studios invested nearly a billion dollars into "The Rings of Power," an adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's world.
   - Despite initial positive media coverage, audience and expert reactions were overwhelmingly negative, leading to significant disappointment among viewers.

4. **Critics’ Bias**: Major studios have been accused of manipulating critical reviews and rankings to skew public perception in favor of their films. This has raised concerns about the integrity of film criticism.

5. **Cultural Impact**:
   - The failure of major productions like "The Rings of Power" and adaptations of popular franchises such as "Sapkowski's Wiedźmin" (The Witcher) have had a significant impact on both viewers' trust in these companies and broader cultural narratives.
   - Fans were deeply disappointed, leading to backlash against the studios involved.

6. **Economic Decline**:
   - The financial losses from major productions and declining audience satisfaction have contributed to an overall downturn in the film industry's economic performance.

7. **Future Discussion**: You mentioned planning a future discussion with economist Mariusz Stefaniak on these broader issues, which is exciting as it will provide deeper insights into how these trends are impacting the economy and global culture.

This conversation highlights the complexities involved in modern entertainment production and distribution, particularly when large studios attempt to control not only content but also public perception through their financial power. The future of this industry looks set for continued scrutiny and potential shifts in how content is produced and consumed.

Thank you for bringing these issues to light! If there's anything specific you'd like me to elaborate on or discuss further, feel free to ask.
