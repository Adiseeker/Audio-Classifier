It seems that the conversation is focusing on the economic and political implications of Poland's decision to stop importing Russian coal in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Mariusz Stefaniak argues against the idea that increased prices are simply due to the war or ethical solidarity, pointing out several key points:

1. **Price Increase**: The cost of coal has increased significantly, with some reports suggesting it has gone up by more than tenfold over a year.
2. **Quality and Cost Differences**: Russian coal was considered both better quality and cheaper compared to alternative sources like opium coal from other countries.
3. **Solidarity and Ethics**: Stefaniak questions the ethics of supporting Ukraine through economic measures that might be seen as indirectly aiding Russia by creating a market for its goods.
4. **China's Aggression**: He raises concerns about engaging in trade with China, citing examples of Chinese military actions against neighboring countries, including recent conflicts on the border with India.

Stefaniak suggests that Poland should not simply continue trading with Russia and ignore what is happening in Ukraine but also consider more cautious approaches to economic policies. Hereâ€™s a summarized response based on his arguments:

**Response:**

The significant increase in coal prices cannot be solely attributed to the war or the sanctions imposed on Russia. The decision to stop importing Russian coal has resulted in higher costs, primarily due to switching to less efficient and more expensive sources. This change not only affects Poland's economy but also questions the ethical implications of supporting Ukraine through economic measures that might inadvertently benefit Russia.

Moreover, trading with China, despite its aggressive actions in border disputes, poses further risks. It is crucial for policymakers to consider both short-term economic impacts and long-term strategic interests when making decisions about international trade.

Given these considerations, Poland should adopt a more measured approach, ensuring that economic policies align not only with immediate economic needs but also with broader geopolitical goals and ethical standards.
