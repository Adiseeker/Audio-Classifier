Hello, Mr. Mariusz. It sounds like you have some interesting insights into the world of forecasts and predictions, especially in fields like economics and finance. Let's delve deeper into these topics.

Firstly, regarding the optimism seen in real estate market forecasts, it's indeed true that developers and landowners often benefit significantly from rising property values. Governments also gain through taxation on increased property values and through regulations that can favor certain segments of the industry. However, is there a risk to the economy if such optimistic forecasts lead to speculative bubbles? How might this affect future economic stability?

Secondly, you mentioned cryptocurrencies as another area where optimism led to unrealistic predictions. Could you elaborate more on the mechanisms behind these speculative markets and how they contribute to economic volatility? Are there any regulatory measures that could help mitigate some of these risks?

Lastly, you touched upon the role of experts in providing accurate forecasts and whether their predictions can be influenced by outside factors such as financial interests or political pressure. How might we ensure that expert opinions are more transparent and less susceptible to bias, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of economic forecasting?

Let's discuss these points further and explore how we can better navigate an economy where optimism often overshadows realistic assessments.
   
What do you think about the current state of economic forecasts in light of recent events like the war in Ukraine? How might these global disruptions affect future predictions and our understanding of economic trends?

Thank you for your insightful comments on the factors that influence expert forecasts. Now, regarding the recent events such as the war in Ukraine, there is indeed a significant impact on global economic forecasts and stability. The geopolitical tensions have led to unprecedented financial market volatility, supply chain disruptions, and increased inflationary pressures.

Mariusz, could you provide some specific examples of how these factors are affecting current economic predictions? Are certain regions or industries more affected than others?

Additionally, with the ongoing pandemic still posing significant challenges, how do these concurrent global crises interact and complicate economic forecasting models? 

Moreover, given the complexity of modern economies, what steps can policymakers take to ensure that forecasts remain relevant and useful for guiding economic policy decisions during such tumultuous times?
