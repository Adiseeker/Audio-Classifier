It seems like we have a discussion centered around entrepreneurship and business conditions in Poland compared to other countries, particularly highlighting some challenges faced by Polish entrepreneurs. Here’s a summary and elaboration on the key points:

### Summary of Key Points:
1. **Decrease in Entrepreneurial Activity:**
   - Poles are suspending companies at an increasing rate, which might indicate a downturn in business confidence.
   - The percentage of people wanting to start a new company has dropped significantly from 2016 (58%) to 2019 (37%).

2. **Positive Aspects:**
   - Poland is still highly entrepreneurial with 78% believing that running one’s own business is a good idea.
   - There is strong respect for entrepreneurs, as indicated by the fact that 77% of Poles believe successful businessmen should be recognized.

3. **Negative Trends:**
   - Media portrayal has become less positive towards entrepreneurship, which could dampen entrepreneurial spirits.
   - The Global Business Complexity Index shows Poland as having among the most complex business regulations in Europe and the world.
   - Young companies are experiencing a decline in numbers, while mature companies are growing.

4. **Comparison with Other Countries:**
   - Switzerland is noted as the best place to run a business due to favorable conditions.
   - Richer countries generally have better conditions for starting and running businesses compared to poorer ones like Poland.

### Elaboration:
- **Media Influence:** The shift in media sentiment towards entrepreneurs from 2016 to 2019 suggests that negative publicity can significantly impact entrepreneurial spirits. This could be due to various factors, such as economic challenges or a general tone of pessimism being conveyed by the media.
  
- **Regulatory Environment:** Poland’s ranking in terms of business complexity highlights significant barriers for starting and running businesses. High regulatory costs and complexities might discourage new ventures even among those who are willing.

- **Economic Factors:** The data shows that while there is a strong desire to be an entrepreneur, the actual ability to start and sustain a business is hindered by practical difficulties such as high taxes (in contrast to Switzerland’s low CIT tax rate). This suggests that despite a positive sentiment towards entrepreneurship, real-world challenges are deterring people.

- **Support Systems:** The discussion hints at a need for more supportive policies from the government. Countries like Switzerland provide better conditions not just because of their wealth but also due to systemic support structures and regulatory frameworks that encourage business growth.

### Conclusion:
The conversation underscores the complex interplay between economic factors, media influence, and policy environment in shaping entrepreneurial behavior. While Poland has a strong cultural foundation for entrepreneurship, practical challenges such as high regulation and negative media narratives are creating obstacles. For Poland to retain its position as a leading entrepreneurial nation, addressing these structural issues could be crucial.
