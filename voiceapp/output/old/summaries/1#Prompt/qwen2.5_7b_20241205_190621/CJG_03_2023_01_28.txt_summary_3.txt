It seems like there are several points being made here that are worth addressing:

1. **The Repeated Statement**: The statement "It is the beginning of the end of the world" repeated multiple times might be a metaphor or a play on words for emphasis, but it doesn't directly relate to the content provided in the latter part.

2. **Rating Discrepancies**: There's a comparison between two ratings:
   - For an unspecified movie (likely referring to "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"), the viewers' rating is 38% and critics' rating is 85%.
   - Another, presumably older, movie had a perfect or near-perfect score from both critics (91%) and viewers (95%).

3. **Critics vs. Viewers**: There's criticism that the critics didn't watch "the same" as the viewers did, suggesting an issue with the validity of some reviews.

4. **Negative Reviews and Criticism**:
   - Amazon paid viewers to watch the show because the ratings were so poor.
   - The results weren't published for a week due to the poor reception.
   - People started paying others to watch the episodes.

5. **Social Issues in Media**: There's an emphasis on representation, particularly regarding race and sexuality, noting that such representations are now common and don't typically cause controversy.

6. **Ideological Interference**:
   - Some believe that political or ideological factors influence who is cast or hired.
   - This can lead to the inclusion of underqualified individuals for purely political reasons.
   - There's concern about the impact on content quality and creative freedom.

7. **Fan Rebellion**: Fans are described as rebelling against what they perceive as poor-quality, ideologically driven shows in favor of high-quality entertainment.

8. **Interviewer Wrap-Up**:
   - The interview guest was Mariusz Stefaniak from the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation.
   - The discussion focused on media criticism and the influence of ideology in content creation.
   - The interviewer thanked the guest and invited listeners to tune in next week for more discussions.

Given this context, here is a summary and a potential continuation or conclusion:

**Summary:**
- The conversation centered around the quality and reception of "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power," highlighting the discrepancy between viewer and critic ratings.
- It also touched on broader issues such as the influence of ideology in media production and the backlash from audiences who prefer high-quality, unpoliticized content.

**Conclusion/Next Steps:**
It's important to note that while there may be valid concerns about the quality of certain productions, it's also crucial for creators and producers to listen to their audience. Engaging directly with feedback can help improve future projects. Additionally, maintaining a balance between representation and quality is key in creating content that resonates with diverse audiences.

For next steps, the conversation might consider:
- Exploring how media companies can better balance ideological representation with creative freedom.
- Discussing strategies for addressing negative reviews and improving content quality.
- Highlighting success stories where quality has prevailed over ideology.
