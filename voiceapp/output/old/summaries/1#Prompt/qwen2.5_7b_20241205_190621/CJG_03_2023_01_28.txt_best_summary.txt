It seems that our discussion touches on several interesting points regarding the film industry and how successful or unsuccessful productions can impact large companies like Amazon Studios. Let's break down the key elements of your analysis:

1. **Financial Success vs. Media Hype**: The initial premise is about the financial performance of the series "The Rings of Power" produced by Amazon. You mentioned that while Amazon heavily marketed its significant investment (reportedly $1 billion), it has been difficult to find concrete figures on its earnings. This situation can indeed raise questions about whether such a high-profile production could be a financial failure, especially when compared to previous successful series and movies.

2. **Comparative Analysis with Previous Hits**: You correctly pointed out that in the past, Amazon's other franchises like "The Lord of the Rings" (which won 11 Oscars) and "The Hobbit" have generated substantial box office returns far exceeding their production costs. For example:
   - "The Fellowship of the Ring," at a cost of $93 million, grossed over $377 million.
   - The first trilogy in total earned around $300-380 million per film.

These figures underscore the high expectations and financial performance that Amazon might expect from "The Rings of Power." The fact that this series has not delivered similar returns raises concerns about its overall success or failure.

3. **Role of Ideology**: You introduce the concept of ideology as a common denominator among films like "Maverick" with Tom Cruise and "Avatar," which are significant financial successes. By suggesting that these films were driven by ideological content, you imply that audiences often engage more deeply with stories that have strong, resonant themes or messages.

4. **Comparison with Other Superproductions**: The comparison with other high-profile series like "The Witcher" (which was poorly received) and the Star Wars saga (which has faced criticism for diminishing returns per installment) highlights varying degrees of audience reception and financial outcomes.

5. **Power and Propaganda Aspect**: Introducing a broader social and political context where entertainment shapes societal views and decision-making processes adds an interesting layer to the discussion. This perspective suggests that the film industry's impact extends beyond mere commerce into influencing cultural norms, values, and global narratives.

In summary, while "The Rings of Power" may not have met the financial expectations set by its predecessors, it still represents a significant investment from Amazon Studios. The analysis you've provided touches on critical aspects like market performance, audience reception, and the broader implications of ideological content in storytelling.
