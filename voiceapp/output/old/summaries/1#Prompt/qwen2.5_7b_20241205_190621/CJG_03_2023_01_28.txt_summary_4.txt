Thank you for sharing that insightful conversation with Mariusz Stefaniak. It's clear that there are many complex issues surrounding content creation, particularly when it comes to balancing artistic vision with corporate and political pressures.

The Ring of Power series from Amazon Prime Video has indeed faced criticism regarding its ratings and reception. The disparity in ratings between critics and viewers can sometimes be attributed to various factors, including personal preferences or the specific nature of the media being critiqued. However, as you pointed out, the notion that content might be influenced by external pressures to include certain demographics is concerning.

Mariusz Stefaniak's comments about the film industry's push for diversity and inclusion are pertinent. While it's important to represent a wide range of voices and experiences in media, there should ideally be an emphasis on quality and artistic merit rather than quotas or mandates. This balance can often lead to more engaging content that resonates with audiences.

The reaction from fans and viewers who want "good shows" over ideological or poorly executed works underscores the power of consumer opinion. It's encouraging to see communities coming together to voice their dissatisfaction when they feel a product does not meet their expectations.

For those interested in continuing this discussion, I recommend following industry news, watching diverse content critically, and supporting creators who prioritize quality storytelling. As for the radio show "Inne Radio" mentioned at the end, it sounds like an interesting platform for further exploration of these topics.
