 It seems like you're sharing a transcript of a conversation or an interview about the current situation with coal and international trade policies, particularly focusing on the impact of the war in Ukraine and the role of China and Russia. Here are some key points and questions that emerged from the discussion:

1. **Increase in Coal Prices**: The price of coal has significantly increased over the past year, from around 350 zlotys per ton to upwards of 2,000 zlotys per ton, with government support pushing it even higher. This increase is not attributed to production costs but rather to other factors.

2. **Import and Quality Issues**: Poland has stopped importing coal from Russia due to sanctions and now imports coal that is both more expensive and of worse quality. The discussion questions whether this move is justified by the moral aspect of supporting Ukraine or if itâ€™s driven by business considerations.

3. **China's Role**: The conversation highlights China's aggressive policies towards neighboring countries, including military conflicts with India and territorial claims over Taiwan. Despite these issues, Poland continues to import coal from China, which also has close ties with Russia.

4. **Moral and Practical Considerations**: There is a moral dilemma regarding whether Poland should maintain trade relations with Russia given the war in Ukraine. The practical implications of suddenly cutting off Russian coal imports are also considered.

5. **Economic Impact**: The discussion raises concerns about the economic wisdom of buying Russian coal at significantly higher prices after initially stopping imports due to sanctions.

6. **Domestic Coal Production**: There is a question about why Poland, as a country with significant coal reserves and mining capabilities, still relies on imported coal from Russia.

To address these points:

- **Price Increase**: The price increase might be due to global supply chain disruptions, increased demand for alternative energy sources, or speculative trading rather than direct production costs.

- **Import Quality and Costs**: Importing coal of lower quality at higher prices could impact domestic industries that rely on coal, increasing their operational costs and potentially leading to layoffs or business closures.

- **China's Aggression**: The discussion points out the hypocrisy of maintaining trade relations with China despite its aggressive policies while sanctioning Russia for similar actions. This highlights a broader geopolitical context that countries must navigate.

- **Moral Dilemma and Practical Implications**: While there is a moral imperative to support Ukraine, abruptly stopping coal imports from Russia could have severe economic consequences. A gradual shift towards alternative suppliers or domestic production might be more practical.

- **Economic Wisdom**: Buying Russian coal at inflated prices after initial sanctions can be seen as economically unwise and highlights the need for a long-term energy strategy that reduces dependence on foreign imports.

- **Domestic Production**: Investing in domestic coal production could reduce reliance on imported coal, boost the economy, and create jobs. However, this must also consider environmental impacts and long-term sustainability goals.

In conclusion, addressing these issues requires a balanced approach that considers both moral imperatives and practical economic implications. A strategic shift towards diversified energy sources and increased domestic production could help mitigate some of these challenges.
