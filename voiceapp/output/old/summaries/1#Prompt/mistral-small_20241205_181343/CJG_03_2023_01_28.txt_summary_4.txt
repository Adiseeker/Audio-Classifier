 The conversation seems to be centered around the reception of a new movie or series adaptation within the context of diversity and inclusion in filmmaking. Here are some key points:

1. **Critical Reception**: There is a stark contrast between critic ratings (85%) and viewer ratings (38%), which has led to speculation that critics' reviews may not genuinely reflect audience experiences.

2. **Audience Discontent**: Audiences are upset with the quality of the production, suggesting that political ideologies have influenced the choice of actors, directors, and showrunners rather than their competencies. This is reminiscent of historical instances where political figures had significant influence over creative projects.

3. **Diversity in Casting**: While the presence of black actors, LGBTQ+ characters, etc., is generally accepted, the issue arises when these choices are perceived as motivated by quotas rather than artistic merit. This has led to backlash from fans who feel their preferences for quality over ideology are being ignored or stifled.

4. **Criticism of Fans**: Those who express dissatisfaction with the production face accusations of racism and other derogatory labels, further straining the relationship between creators and audience.

The conversation ends by thanking Mariusz Stefaniak for his insights and inviting listeners to tune in next week to "Inne Radio".
