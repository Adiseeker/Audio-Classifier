 It seems like there are several issues that viewers have with the new iteration of Peter Jackson's movie, particularly "The Rings of Power." Here are some key points:

1. **Critical Ratings Disparity**: The film has a significant disparity between critic and viewer ratings (85% from critics vs. 38% from viewers). This suggests that while critics may have enjoyed the movie, regular viewers did not.

2. **Allegations of Bought Reviews**: Some viewers believe that the positive reviews from critics are not genuine but rather bought to inflate the film's ratings artificially.

3. **Viewer Incentives**: There were reports that Amazon paid viewers in certain countries to watch the show, indicating poor initial viewership numbers and a desire to boost those numbers.

4. **Ideological Concerns**: Viewers are also concerned about the ideological motivations behind casting decisions. They feel that actors are chosen based on their adherence to certain political or social ideologies rather than their acting abilities. This includes ensuring diversity in terms of race and sexual orientation, which viewers see as forced and not based on merit.

5. **Quality Concerns**: Overall, there is a strong sentiment that the movie is of poor quality and does not meet viewer expectations. Viewers feel that they are being fed propaganda rather than enjoying good entertainment.

6. **Backlash and Labeling**: Viewers who express their dislike for the film often face backlash, with some being labeled as racists or bigots, which further fuels the controversy.

These issues highlight a broader problem in the film industry where there is a growing tension between the desire for representation and diversity on one hand, and maintaining high standards of quality and merit-based selection on the other.
