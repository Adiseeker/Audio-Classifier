 Based on the conversation, here are the key points about the economy that Mariusz Stefaniak is concerned about:

1. **Minimum Wage and Maximum Price Indicators**: He believes these regulations indicate an unhealthy market, as they show that the free market rules aren't working properly.

2. **Fuel Prices**: He argues that fuel prices have become absurd and don't reflect economic reality. He attributes this to political decisions rather than the war in Ukraine.

3. **Coal Imports from Russia**: Poland has stopped importing coal from Russia, which he believes is not due to the war but a political decision. This has led to a shortage of coal and increased prices.

4. **Sanctions Against Russia**: Stefaniak views these sanctions as ineffective and a "media fake". He believes Russian banks are still functioning normally, and Russia is able to sell its resources through other countries.

5. **Impact on Polish Companies and Households**: Due to increased energy prices, many Polish companies are facing bankruptcy, and households are struggling financially. He gives an example of a woman who can't afford coal for heating despite working honestly for years.

6. **Coal Mines in Poland**: Many coal mines in Poland have been closed, leading to a lack of domestic supply. This, combined with the halt on Russian imports, has driven up coal prices significantly.

Stefaniak blames these issues on political decisions and argues that they are causing more harm than good. He believes the Polish economy is in a tragic state due to these policies.
