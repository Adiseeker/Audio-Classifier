 It seems like you're sharing a transcript from a Polish radio show or podcast discussing economic issues, specifically about credit, banks, and society's decision-making process. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Credit and Faith in the Future**: The speaker, Maciej Stefaniak, suggests that taking long-term loans (20-30 years) indicates faith in one's ability to pay it off in the future. If people are not taking loans, it might imply a loss of this faith.

2. **Banks' Role**: However, Stefaniak argues that the decrease in loan uptake is not due to people being smarter or more cautious. Instead, banks are less willing to give out preferential loans. People would still take them if offered.

3. **Lack of Economic Knowledge**: The speaker compares the situation to an alcoholic who can't buy vodka, suggesting that just because someone isn't taking a loan doesn't mean they're suddenly smarter or have learned from past mistakes.

4. **Need for More Wisdom**: Stefaniak emphasizes the need for more wisdom in society and smarter decision-making, which is one of the goals of his foundation.

5. **Audience Engagement**: The host, Krzysztof Strauchman, thanks the audience and invites them to tune in next week.

The conversation seems to revolve around the importance of financial literacy and the role of banks in shaping society's economic behavior.
