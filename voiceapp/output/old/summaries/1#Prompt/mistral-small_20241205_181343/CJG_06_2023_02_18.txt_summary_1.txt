 It seems like you're sharing a transcript from a Polish radio show discussing the Polish economy, energy policies, and environmental issues. Here are some key points from the conversation:

1. **Economic concerns**: The speaker is worried about the strength of the Polish economy due to what they perceive as violent political movements against it. They mention that cheap energy is crucial for economic development, but Poland is making energy expensive by relying on imports and not using domestic fossil fuels.

2. **Environmental issues**: The speaker acknowledges health problems caused by air pollution, such as respiratory diseases. However, they also argue that a significant portion of this pollution comes from illegal waste imports from other European countries.

3. **Global perspective on pollution**: They point out that China and the USA are the world's biggest polluters, but Poland is being singled out for criticism while maintaining strong economic ties with these countries.

4. **Economic impact of energy policies**: The speaker expresses concern about the increasing cost of coal, which they believe will lead to a severe crisis, including mass suicides due to stress and hopelessness. They also mention that children in Poland are already going hungry.

The conversation ends with an invitation for the guest, Mariusz Stefania, to return for future discussions on these topics.
