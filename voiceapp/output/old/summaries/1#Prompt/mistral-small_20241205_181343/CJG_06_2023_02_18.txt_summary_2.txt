 It seems like you're sharing a transcript from a Polish radio show discussing economic issues, specifically regarding energy policies, pollution, and their potential impact on the economy and health of citizens. Here are some key points from the conversation:

1. **Economic Concerns**: The speaker is worried about the strong Polish economy being weakened by expensive energy policies. They argue that cheap energy is crucial for economic development, and making it more expensive could lead to a significant crisis.

2. **Health Issues**: There's concern about air pollution caused by both local coal use and illegal waste imports from other countries. The speaker mentions that high concentrations of particulate matter can lead to premature deaths.

3. **Global Pollution**: While acknowledging that China and the US are the largest polluters globally, the speaker argues that Poland is disproportionately affected by pollution due to its geographical location and policies.

4. **Economic Impact**: The speaker warns of a potential economic crisis, with rising energy costs leading to company collapses and increased poverty among citizens. They also express concern about the mental health impact of such a crisis, potentially leading to an increase in suicides due to stress and hopelessness.

5. **Lack of Media Coverage**: The speaker laments that these issues are not getting enough attention from mainstream media.
