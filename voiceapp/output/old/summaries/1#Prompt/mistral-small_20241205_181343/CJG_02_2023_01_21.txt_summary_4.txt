 The discussion highlights several key points about the current state of the cinema industry, particularly in relation to big-budget productions and their impact on both finances and public perception:

### Key Points:

1. **Breakthrough Year for Losses**:
   - 2022 marked a significant shift where major film studios started incurring losses rather than profits from their biggest productions.
   - Examples include losses of $200 million from a single movie.

2. **Case Study: "The Rings of Power"**:
   - Amazon Studios invested nearly a billion dollars in the production, an unprecedented sum even for Hollywood standards.
   - Despite being marketed as a huge success, independent experts and ordinary viewers had contrasting opinions, which were often suppressed or ignored.
   - The discrepancy between the media's positive portrayal and actual viewer satisfaction led to a backlash.

3. **Manipulation of Perception**:
   - There is an alleged practice in the industry where large companies influence critics and evaluation platforms to promote favorable opinions about their productions.
   - This manipulation creates a disconnect between the marketed success and genuine audience reception, leading to dissatisfaction.

4. **Sapkowski's "The Witcher"**:
   - Another example is the adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowskiâ€™s "The Witcher," which faced severe criticism from fans due to its deviation from the source material and perceived mockery of Polish culture and history.
   - The backlash was significant, with even lead actors expressing discontent.

### General Observations:

- **Industry Attitude Towards Audience**:
  - There is a pervasive attitude within the industry that views the audience as naive or stupid, which leads to productions that do not meet expectations.

- **Market Decline**:
  - The cumulative effect of these negative experiences and audience dissatisfaction has contributed to a general decline in the market.

### Broader Implications:

- **Economic Impact**:
  - The financial losses from big productions affect not just the studios but also have wider economic implications.

- **Cultural Impact**:
  - The way mass culture handles and portrays different cultures and histories can lead to significant backlashes if not handled sensitively.

### Future Discussion:

The conversation plans to delve deeper into how these dynamics in mass culture affect the broader economy and global situation. Listeners are invited to tune in for a more detailed exploration of these issues on Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 AM.

This discussion provides a critical insight into the current state of the entertainment industry, highlighting the tension between corporate interests, public perception, and genuine creative output.
