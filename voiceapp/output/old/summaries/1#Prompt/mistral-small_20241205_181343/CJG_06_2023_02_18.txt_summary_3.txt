 It seems like the text is a transcription of a Polish radio interview or discussion about energy policies, pollution, and their impact on the economy and health. The speaker, Mariusz Stefania, expresses concerns about the direction of Poland's energy policies, specifically regarding the transition away from fossil fuels and its potential consequences for the economy and public health. Here are some key points raised in the text:

1. **Energy Prices**: The speaker argues that increasing energy prices, especially due to the shift away from cheap fossil fuel-based energy, will negatively impact the economy and lead to higher costs for consumers.

2. **Health Issues**: There is a mention of health concerns related to air pollution, with an estimate that 50,000 people in Poland die each year due to diseases caused by high concentrations of particulate matter.

3. **Illegal Waste Importation**: The speaker alleges that Poland is used as a "dumping ground" for illegal waste from other European countries, contributing significantly to air pollution.

4. **Global Pollution Statistics**: The speaker points out that China and the USA are the largest polluters globally but argues that Poland is being disproportionately affected by environmental policies.

5. **Economic Consequences**: There is a concern that increasing energy costs will lead to economic hardship, including potential bankruptcies and suicides due to stress and lack of hope.

6. **Invitation for Further Discussion**: The speaker is invited back for further discussion in the next edition of the program.

The overall tone is critical of current policies, suggesting that they are detrimental to Poland's economic and social well-being. The conversation highlights the complex interplay between environmental regulations, energy prices, health issues, and economic stability.
