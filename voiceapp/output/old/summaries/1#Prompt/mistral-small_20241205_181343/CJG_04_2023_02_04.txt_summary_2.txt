 It seems like you've shared a segment from a Polish interview or discussion, likely from a radio show or podcast, with an economist named Maciej Stefaniak. The conversation touches on several points about the economy, banks, and public perception. Here’s a summary of key points:

1. **Influence in Politics**: There is a recognition that wealthy individuals (giants) can influence politicians, rulers, and officials more effectively than average citizens. This influence often shapes regulations in their favor.

2. **Credit and Faith in the Future**: Taking long-term loans indicates faith in the future and confidence in one’s ability to repay. A decrease in loan activity might reflect a drop in this optimism.

3. **Banking Restrictions**: The decline in lending is not due to people suddenly becoming more cautious or smarter about their financial decisions but rather because banks are less willing to provide loans on favorable terms.

4. **Lack of Financial Acumen**: People who previously took out loans without sufficient economic knowledge continue to lack that knowledge, indicating a broader issue with financial literacy in society.

5. **Analogy with Addiction**: Stefaniak uses the analogy of an alcoholic to illustrate his point—if someone can’t buy alcohol, it doesn't mean they’ve become wiser; they simply lack access and funds. Similarly, people’s willingness to take loans hasn’t changed; banks have just tightened their lending policies.

6. **Need for Wisdom**: The discussion emphasizes the need for greater wisdom in society to make better financial decisions.

7. **Invitation for Future Conversations**: Stefaniak concludes by inviting listeners back for more discussions, highlighting his role as an economist and financial expert with the "Foundation for More Wisdom."

This conversation underscores the importance of understanding economic behavior, the influence of powerful entities on regulations, and the necessity for improved financial literacy among the general public.
