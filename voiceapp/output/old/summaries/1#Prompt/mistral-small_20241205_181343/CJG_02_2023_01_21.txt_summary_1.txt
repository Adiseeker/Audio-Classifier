 It seems like you're discussing a shift in the cinema industry where big-budget productions are not performing as expected, leading to significant losses for studios. You mentioned "Rings of Power" from Tolkien's world and a series based on Sapkowski's "Wied≈∫min" (The Witcher) as examples of these failures. The common theme is that while the companies behind these productions touted them as successful, the general audience and independent experts disagreed, leading to backlash and economic decline in the market.

Here are some points you raised that might be contributing to this situation:

1. **Inflated expectations**: When a lot of money is put into a production, audiences expect something monumental. If the final product doesn't meet these expectations, it can lead to disappointment and backlash.

2. **Manipulation of public opinion**: You suggested that big companies might be paying critics and buying out movie evaluation companies to manipulate public opinion about their productions. This can create a false narrative around the success of a film or series.

3. **Disrespect towards source material and fans**: In the case of adaptations like "Rings of Power" and "The Witcher", there's a sense that the creators are disrespecting the original work and its fans. This can lead to strong backlash from dedicated audiences.

4. **Economic impact**: These failures have led to significant losses for the studios involved, contributing to an overall decline in the market.

For your next meeting, you plan to discuss how this situation in mass culture affects the economy and global situation. It would be interesting to explore these connections further.
