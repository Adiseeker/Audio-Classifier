 It seems like you're sharing a conversation or an interview with Mariusz Stefaniak. Here's a summary of the key points discussed:

1. **Forecast Accuracy**: Some forecasts from the year before, especially about inflation and the housing market, turned out to be incorrect. This is not surprising as experts can face pressure or influence that affects their predictions.

2. **Real Estate Market**: The optimistic forecasts for the real estate market were likely driven by the profitability of this sector. Governments also benefit from a thriving real estate market.

3. **Cryptocurrency Market**: Similarly, the cryptocurrency market's growth was predicted to continue, but these predictions did not come true. The market operates on speculative principles, with some players benefiting at the expense of others.

4. **Experts and Influence**: While there are good experts, those who are most promoted by governments, media, or corporations often have their messages shaped by these entities. Independent voices may not reach the public as easily.

5. **Predictability of Events**: The Russian attack on Ukraine was predictable based on documented data available months before the event. However, this information did not reach public opinion.

6. **COVID Pandemic**: COVID-19 was a real threat to human health, but its most devastating impact has been economic, financial, and social. The virus primarily attacks humans, not economies.

The conversation touches on the complexities of expert predictions, influences on these predictions, and the reality versus perception of global events and threats.
