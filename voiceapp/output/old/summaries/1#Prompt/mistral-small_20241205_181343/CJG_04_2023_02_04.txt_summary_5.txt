 It seems like you're sharing a transcript of a conversation between an economist, Maciej Stefaniak, and a host, Krzysztof Strauchman. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Influence of Giants**: Stefaniak argues that while ordinary people can't influence politicians or officials, large corporations (giants) can due to their financial power.

2. **Credit and Faith in the Future**: He discusses how taking long-term loans (20-30 years) requires faith in the future and the ability to pay it off. A decrease in loan-taking could indicate lost confidence, but he believes people are still willing to take loans if banks offer them.

3. **Lack of Financial Wisdom**: Stefaniak compares people's financial behavior to that of an alcoholic. Just because someone can't buy alcohol (or in this case, take a loan), doesn't mean they're smarter or have learned from past mistakes. They're still willing to make the same poor decisions given the opportunity.

4. **Purpose of the Audition**: He suggests that the purpose of their conversation is to promote financial wisdom and smart decision-making in society.

5. **Contact Information**: The transcript also includes contact information for the show, Astronarium, on Facebook and a website.

The conversation seems to be in Polish, with some words translated into English. The main themes revolve around financial literacy, influence, and decision-making in society.
