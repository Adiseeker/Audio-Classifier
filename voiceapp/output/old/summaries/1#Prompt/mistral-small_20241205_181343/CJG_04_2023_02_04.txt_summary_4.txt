 It seems like you're sharing a transcript of a conversation between an economist, Maciej Stefaniak, and someone named Krzysztof Strauchman, about banking, politics, and consumer behavior. Here's a brief summary:

1. **Political Influence**: Stefaniak argues that only powerful entities (giants) can influence politicians and officials due to their ability to offer large sums of money. Regulations are designed to favor these giants.

2. **Credit and Consumer Confidence**: He discusses how taking long-term loans indicates faith in the future and the ability to repay. A decrease in loans might suggest a loss of confidence, but Stefaniak believes people would still take loans if offered.

3. **Consumer Behavior**: He uses an analogy of an alcoholic not being able to buy vodka (due to lack of money or availability) to illustrate that people's willingness to take loans doesn't mean they're suddenly wiser; it's more about the banks' willingness to lend and the consumers' ability to pay.

4. **Purpose of the Audition**: The conversation is part of an effort to promote wisdom and smarter decisions in society.
