 It seems like you're discussing recent trends and challenges in the film industry, particularly focusing on high-budget films and their reception by audiences and critics. Here are some key points from your discussion:

1. **Shift in Dynamics**: Big companies that previously made significant profits from distributing cinema tickets faced substantial losses in 2022. This shift is attributed to several factors.

2. **Case Studies**:
   - **"Rings of Power"**: Amazon Studios spent almost $1 billion on this project, expecting it to be a massive hit like previous Tolkien adaptations by Peter Jackson. Despite being marketed as a success, the reception among viewers and independent experts was negative, highlighting a disconnect between corporate promotion and audience opinion.
   - **The Witcher**: Another high-profile example where a popular brand (created by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski) was adapted into a series but met with criticism from fans due to perceived disrespect for the source material. Even the lead actor left in protest.

3. **Impact on the Market**: The decline in quality and misalignment between corporate marketing and audience expectations have contributed to a general decline in the market. Viewers are becoming more discerning and less willing to accept subpar productions, leading to economic impacts.

4. **Future Discussion**: You plan to delve deeper into these issues in future discussions, exploring how trends in mass culture affect the broader economy and global situation.

Your discussion raises important questions about the power dynamics between corporations and audiences, the role of critics and evaluators, and the economic consequences of declining quality in high-budget productions. It's a complex landscape that merits further exploration.
