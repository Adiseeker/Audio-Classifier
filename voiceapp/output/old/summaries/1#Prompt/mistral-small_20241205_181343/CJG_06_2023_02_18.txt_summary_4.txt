 It seems like you're sharing a transcript from a Polish radio show discussion about energy policies, pollution, and the economy. Here are some key points and questions raised:

1. **Energy Policies:**
   - The speaker is concerned about the shift towards expensive renewable energy sources and away from cheap fossil fuels, which they believe hinders economic growth.
   - They argue that if moral and ideological reasons were truly at play, Poland would have stopped doing business with China long ago due to their human rights abuses.

2. **Pollution:**
   - The speaker mentions high levels of air pollution in Poland, attributing it partly to the burning of imported waste from Europe.
   - They question why coal is singled out as bad when looking at global statistics, and point out that China and the USA are responsible for most of the world's pollution.

3. **Economic Impact:**
   - The speaker expresses fear that increasing energy costs will lead to a economic crisis, with companies collapsing and people losing hope, potentially leading to mass suicides.
   - They mention that while children aren't currently starving in Poland, the situation is dire and could worsen.

4. **Government Policies:**
   - The speaker feels that Poland is being sacrificed for the sake of ideology or to please certain groups (like the Pope).

5. **Next Edition:**
   - The discussion will continue in the next edition of the hearing.

To engage with this topic, you might want to consider the following questions:

- How do renewable energy policies impact economic growth, and are there any long-term benefits that outweigh short-term costs?
- What can be done about air pollution in Poland, particularly regarding imported waste?
- Should moral and ideological reasons play a role in economic decision-making, and if so, how should they be balanced with practical concerns?
- How can governments support citizens and businesses during economic transitions to prevent crises?
