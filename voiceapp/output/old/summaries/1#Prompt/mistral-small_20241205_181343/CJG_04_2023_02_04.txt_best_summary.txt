 It seems like you're sharing a transcript of a Polish radio show discussing the current state of the real estate market with an economist, Mariusz Stefaniak. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Housing Loans**: There's been a significant decrease (around 30%) in housing loans taken by Poles compared to last year. This is due to banks being less willing to lend, not necessarily because people don't want to borrow.

2. **Housing Prices**: Despite the decrease in loan amounts, housing prices have not significantly dropped. However, there are signs of rental prices stabilizing or even decreasing slightly after a long period of increases.

3. **Influx of Ukrainians**: The influx of Ukrainian refugees has caused an unusual situation in the real estate market, leading to increased demand and driving up prices. Despite this, there are still drops in prices, indicating that the market is unequal and prices must fall.

4. **Banks' Role**: Banks have become more cautious due to the high reference rate set by the National Bank of Poland, making loans more expensive. However, inflation is not the main reason for this, but rather an unhealthy market system.

5. **Government Intervention**: The government has proposed measures like additional fees on companies buying flats in bulk to protect Poles who can't compete. Stefaniak believes the government should not focus on decreasing housing prices.
