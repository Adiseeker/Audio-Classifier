 It seems like the conversation revolves around the current state and challenges faced by small businesses in Poland, comparing it to other European countries. Here are some key points raised:

1. **Decreasing Entrepreneurship**: There's a noticeable decline in entrepreneurial spirit among Poles, with fewer people interested in starting new companies compared to previous years. This is evidenced by the drop in the percentage of people willing to start a company from 6% in 2019 to half the European average.

2. **Media Perception**: Positive media coverage about entrepreneurship has significantly decreased, potentially influencing public perception and interest in starting businesses.

3. **Regulatory Complexity**: Poland ranks high in terms of business complexity, making it difficult for entrepreneurs to navigate regulations and thrive. This could be a significant deterrent for potential new business owners.

4. **Support and Infrastructure**: The conversation hints at the lack of support from both the media and the state, which could make the environment less favorable for small businesses compared to other European countries.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: While Poland leads in some aspects like the number of mature companies, it lags behind in supporting new and young businesses. This discrepancy suggests that while established businesses may be thriving, there are significant barriers for new enterprises.

6. **Energy Costs**: Recent increases in energy costs add another layer of difficulty, making it harder for small businesses to operate profitably.

These points highlight the challenges faced by the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Poland and suggest areas where improvements could be made to foster a more supportive environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
