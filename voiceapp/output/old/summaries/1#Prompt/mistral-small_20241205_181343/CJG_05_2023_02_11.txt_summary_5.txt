 It seems like you've shared a transcript of a conversation about the state of the economy, specifically regarding energy prices and sanctions on Russia. Here are some key points from the discussion:

1. **Economic Indicators**: The speaker mentions indicators such as minimum wage and maximum price regulations, suggesting that these are signs of an unhealthy market economy. They believe that healthy market rules do not work in this context.

2. **Fuel Prices**: The discussion highlights the issue of fuel prices being too high and not reflecting the economic reality. The speaker argues that this is not due to the war in Ukraine but rather political decisions.

3. **Coal Supply**: There's a mention of a shortage of coal, specifically 10 million tons that were previously imported from Russia. The speaker attributes this shortage to political decisions rather than the war.

4. **Sanctions on Russia**: The speaker is critical of financial sanctions against Russia, calling them "concrete nonsense" and a media fake. They argue that transactions are being rerouted through Chinese banks.

5. **Impact on Businesses and Consumers**: The conversation touches on the dire consequences for Polish companies and consumers due to high energy costs. A woman's case is highlighted, where she struggles to afford coal for heating despite working honestly.

6. **Coal Mines**: The speaker points out that many coal mines in Poland have been closed, leading to a dependence on imported coal and exacerbating the current crisis.

The overall tone of the conversation suggests significant frustration with the economic policies and their impacts on both businesses and individual consumers.
