It sounds like you've shared a transcript from a radio show that delves into some deep reflections on business, finance, politics, and personal growth. The guest, Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert, shares his insights gained from being in close proximity to influential figures in these fields. His perspective has led him to view political views and decisions differently and emphasizes the importance of following the flow of money to uncover truths.

The poem at the end captures a sense of reflection on the past year, questioning gains and losses, both financial and personal, while acknowledging the broader context of global challenges such as war, crisis, and rising fuel prices. It also suggests that through these experiences, one can become wiser.
