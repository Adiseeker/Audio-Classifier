It sounds like you've shared a segment from a radio show that delves into topics of business, finance, and politics, featuring an economist and financial expert named Mariusz Stefaniak. The discussion seems to touch on how personal experiences with high-level figures can alter one's perspective on political and economic matters, as well as the importance of following the flow of money to uncover truths.

The poem included provides a reflective summary of the year that has passed, touching on gains, losses, and global issues like war and rising fuel prices. It also suggests a personal growth in understanding these complex matters.

The show appears to be called "Grany" (which might translate to "Matters" or "Issues"), conducted by Krzysztof Strauchman, and it's broadcast on Inne Radio in Głuchołazy at 105.2 FM, with a presence on YouTube as well.

If you have any specific questions or need further insights into the topics discussed, feel free to ask!
