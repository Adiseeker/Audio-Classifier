It seems like you've shared a detailed and passionate discussion about the changes and issues within the film and entertainment industry, particularly focusing on the economic impact of big-budget productions that didn't meet audience expectations. Let me summarize and break down some key points from your conversation:

1. **Economic Impact of Cinema Distribution**: Big companies in the cinema network earn substantial revenue from distributing tickets for major films. A single movie can generate hundreds of millions of dollars, which is significant even for large corporations.

2. **Shift in 2022**: There was a notable shift in 2022 where major film studios began to experience significant losses instead of profits. For example, some movies lost around $200 million each. This is a stark contrast to previous years and highlights the volatility in the industry.

3. **Case Study: "The Rings of Power"**: The Amazon Prime series based on J.R.R. Tolkien's works, produced by Amazon Studios, was a significant investmentâ€”almost a billion dollars. Despite the massive budget and initial media hype claiming it as a success, the series faced harsh criticism from ordinary viewers and independent experts. There were allegations that Amazon influenced critical opinions through financial means.

4. **Impact of Audience Expectations**: When audiences invest time and money in highly anticipated productions, their expectations are high. If these expectations are not met, it can lead to strong negative reactions. The analogy used with the Skoda car illustrates how increased investment does not always equate to better quality or satisfaction.

5. **Polish Example: "The Witcher"**: Another example discussed was the Netflix series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's "Witcher" books. Despite the source material being a beloved and successful brand, the adaptation faced criticism for what some perceived as a lack of respect for the original work. This led to significant backlash from fans, including the departure of leading actor Henry Cavill.

6. **General Decline in the Market**: The cumulative effect of these high-profile failures has contributed to a broader decline in the entertainment market. Audiences are becoming more discerning and less willing to accept subpar content, even if it is heavily marketed or comes from big-name companies.

7. **Future Discussions**: You mentioned that future discussions will delve deeper into how changes in mass culture affect the economy and global situations. This suggests a broader exploration of cultural and economic trends.

This conversation underscores the complex relationship between audience expectations, corporate investments, and the quality of content in the entertainment industry. It also highlights the importance of respecting original works and audience sentiments to avoid negative backlash and financial losses.
