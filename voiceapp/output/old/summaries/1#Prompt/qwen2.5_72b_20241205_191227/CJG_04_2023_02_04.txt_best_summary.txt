topic for discussion. The measures you mentioned—such as imposing additional fees on companies buying flats in bulk—are attempts to regulate the market and protect individual buyers from being priced out by large investors who can afford to buy multiple properties at once. However, whether these measures will effectively lead to a decrease in housing prices is debatable.

### Key Points:
1. **Market Health:**
   - The real estate market in Poland is described as "structurally unhealthy" due to various factors, including the influx of refugees from Ukraine and broader economic issues.
   - This structural issue is not solely due to inflation but is a result of deeper systemic problems.

2. **Banks and Loans:**
   - Banks have become more cautious about issuing loans, which has contributed to a decrease in housing loan applications.
   - The high reference rate set by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) has made loans more expensive, further discouraging borrowing.

3. **Government Interventions:**
   - The government is considering measures like imposing additional fees on bulk property purchases by companies to protect individual buyers.
   - These interventions aim to address the imbalance in the market but may not necessarily lead to a significant drop in housing prices.

4. **Price Trends:**
   - Despite the influx of Ukrainian refugees, which initially drove up demand and prices, there are signs that prices are starting to fall.
   - The decline is more pronounced after the initial spike, and the overall trend suggests a cooling market.

5. **Future Outlook:**
   - If the current trends continue, especially with the structural issues in the economy, it is likely that housing prices will continue to drop.
   - However, the extent of these drops and their impact on the broader economy remain uncertain.

### Conclusion:
The real estate market in Poland is facing a complex set of challenges. While government interventions aim to protect individual buyers, they may not be enough to address the underlying structural issues. The market's health will depend on a combination of economic policies, regulatory measures, and broader economic conditions. It will be important to monitor these trends closely to understand their long-term implications.
