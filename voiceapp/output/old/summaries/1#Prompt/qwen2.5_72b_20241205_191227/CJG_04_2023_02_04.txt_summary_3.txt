Thank you for sharing this insightful conversation with Maciej Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert. The points raised touch on several important economic and societal issues:

1. **Influence of Giants**: The idea that large corporations or wealthy individuals have a disproportionate influence over politicians, rulers, and officials is a common concern in discussions about economic inequality and political power. Regulations are often designed to mitigate this influence, but their effectiveness can vary.

2. **Credit and Future Faith**: The willingness to take on long-term credit (like 20-30 year loans) is indeed a reflection of faith in the future. It suggests that individuals believe they will have stable income and economic conditions to meet their financial obligations. When banks are less willing to lend, it can be an indicator of broader economic caution or stricter lending standards, rather than a change in individual behavior.

3. **Behavioral Economics**: The point about people not necessarily becoming smarter or more financially savvy over time is interesting. It aligns with the field of behavioral economics, which studies how psychological factors influence economic decisions. People's tendencies to repeat past mistakes, especially in financial matters, can be attributed to a lack of education, cognitive biases, and sometimes just human nature.

4. **Role of Banks**: The role of banks as gatekeepers for credit is crucial. If banks tighten their lending criteria, it can significantly impact the economy by reducing consumer spending and investment. This can be a response to perceived risks in the economic environment, regulatory changes, or internal risk management policies.

5. **Societal Wisdom**: The goal of increasing societal wisdom through education and awareness is commendable. Financial literacy programs and public discussions like this one can help individuals make more informed decisions, which can have positive ripple effects on the broader economy.
