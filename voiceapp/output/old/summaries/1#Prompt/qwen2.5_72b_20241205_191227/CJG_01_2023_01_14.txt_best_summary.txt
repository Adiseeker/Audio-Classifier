It sounds like you've shared a transcript from a radio show or podcast that delves into some deep topics around business, finance, politics, and personal worldviews. The speaker, Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert, shares insights gained from his close encounters with high-level individuals in these fields, emphasizing how such experiences can significantly alter one's perspective.

The poem he recites serves as a poignant summary of the year’s events, touching on economic gains and losses, the impact of war and crisis, and the rising cost of living. It also reflects on personal growth and the value of gaining deeper understanding in complex times.

Here are some key points from the discussion:

1. **Perspective Change**: Being close to authority figures can provide a different view of how things work, often revealing complexities not visible from a distance.
2. **Economic and Political Insights**: The speaker’s professional life has given him unique insights into economic and political decisions, leading him to question or change his previous views.
3. **Following the Money**: An old Latin saying suggests that to find the truth, one should follow the path of money. This is presented as a useful approach for understanding complex issues.
4. **Hidden Matters**: The show aims to discuss topics that are often hidden from public view, providing listeners with deeper insights and encouraging them to think critically.

The transcript ends with a note about the program being conducted by Krzysztof Strauchman on Inne Radio in Głuchołazy, which can be found at 105.2 FM or on YouTube.
