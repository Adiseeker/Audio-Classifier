It sounds like you’re delving into a complex and nuanced discussion about the film industry, particularly focusing on how ideological influences can impact the success or failure of major productions. Let’s break down some key points from your conversation:

### 1. **The Financial Performance of "The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy:**
   - The original "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, was a massive financial and critical success. Each film in the trilogy earned significantly more than its production cost, with the first part, "The Fellowship of the Ring," earning over $871 million worldwide on a budget of around $93 million.
   - The trilogy won numerous awards, including 17 Oscars out of 30 nominations, setting a high bar for any subsequent adaptations or related productions.

### 2. **Amazon’s "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power":**
   - Amazon invested a reported $1 billion in the production of "The Rings of Power," making it one of the most expensive TV series ever made.
   - Despite the massive investment, there is a notable lack of transparency regarding its financial performance. This absence of data could be interpreted as a sign that the series did not meet financial expectations.
   - Amazon and Jeff Bezos are known for their tendency to publicize successes, so the lack of boasting about the series' earnings is indeed suspicious.

### 3. **The Role of Ideology in Film Success:**
   - You mentioned that ideology could be a common denominator in the success or failure of major productions. This idea suggests that films and TV shows that align with certain ideological perspectives may resonate more (or less) with audiences.
   - For example, "The Witcher" series faced criticism for its casting choices and narrative decisions, which some viewers found to be ideologically driven and not in line with their expectations of the source material. Similarly, recent Star Wars films have been criticized for their perceived ideological shifts, leading to a backlash from some fans.
   - On the other hand, "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Avatar" were both significant financial successes, possibly because they appealed more broadly without being heavily influenced by specific ideological agendas.

### 4. **The Film Industry as a Tool of Propaganda:**
   - The film industry is not just about entertainment; it also plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and cultural narratives. This makes it a powerful tool for propaganda.
   - Media companies, aware of this power, may sometimes prioritize ideological messages over commercial success, which can lead to mixed results.

### 5. **Financial Impact on Companies:**
   - The financial performance of major productions can have significant implications for the companies behind them. For example, while "Avatar" has been a massive success for Disney (which now owns the franchise), "The Rings of Power" could be a significant financial risk for Amazon if it fails to recoup its costs.
   - This highlights the importance of careful planning and market research in the film industry, as well as the need to balance creative vision with commercial viability.

### Conclusion:
The discussion you’re having is part of a broader conversation about the intersection of entertainment, ideology, and business. The success or failure of a production like "The Rings of Power" can be influenced by multiple factors, including financial investment, audience expectations, and ideological alignment. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone interested in the film industry and its impact on society.
