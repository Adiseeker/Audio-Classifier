It sounds like you've shared a transcript or summary of a radio program that delves into some deep reflections on business, finance, politics, and personal perspectives gained from high-level interactions within these fields. The speaker, Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financial expert, shares his insights on how close encounters with influential figures have altered his views on political decisions and economic knowledge.

The program also touches on the Latin phrase "Si vis veritatem, sequere pecuniam" (If you want to reach the truth, follow the path of money), suggesting that understanding where and how money flows can reveal deeper truths about societal structures and decision-making processes.

The poem at the end reflects on the passing year, questioning gains and losses in various investments like Bitcoin and real estate, while also noting the broader challenges such as war, crisis, and rising fuel prices. It encapsulates a sense of personal growth and the pursuit of understanding complex matters that are often hidden from public view.

This kind of content can be very engaging for listeners interested in gaining deeper insights into how economic and political decisions affect their lives and the world around them. If you have any specific questions or if there's another aspect of this topic you'd like to explore, feel free to ask!
