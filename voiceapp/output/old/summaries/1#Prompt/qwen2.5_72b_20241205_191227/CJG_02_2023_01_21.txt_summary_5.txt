It sounds like you've been discussing a complex and multifaceted issue regarding the entertainment industry, particularly focusing on the financial and cultural impacts of big-budget productions that have not met audience expectations. Let's break down some of the key points:

### Financial Losses in Big Productions (2022)
- **Breakthrough Year**: 2022 was a significant year where major film studios started to incur substantial losses instead of profits.
- **Example: "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"**
  - **Investment**: Amazon invested almost a billion dollars, which is unprecedented in the industry.
  - **Marketing and Criticism**:
    - The series was heavily marketed as a success by mainstream media.
    - However, there was significant backlash from ordinary viewers and independent experts who felt the quality did not justify the investment.
  - **Manipulation of Reviews**: There were allegations that Amazon bought out critics and review platforms to skew opinions positively.

### Cultural Impact
- **Expectations vs. Reality**:
  - High investments often set high expectations among audiences.
  - When these expectations are not met, it can lead to significant disappointment and backlash.
- **Example: "The Witcher" (Based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Works)**
  - The series was produced by a major company but received criticism for not staying true to the source material.
  - This led to protests from fans, including the departure of the lead actor.

### Industry Practices
- **Manipulation and Control**:
  - Large companies sometimes use their financial power to control narratives and reviews, which can create a disconnect between official success claims and audience reception.
- **Audience Reactions**:
  - As people become more aware of these practices, they are less willing to accept poor quality content, leading to a general decline in the market.

### Economic Impact
- **Market Decline**:
  - The combination of financial losses and audience disillusionment has contributed to an overall decline in the entertainment industry.
- **Future Implications**:
  - This trend could lead to more cautious investment decisions and a shift towards projects that better align with audience expectations.

### Conclusion
The situation you described highlights the tension between the commercial interests of large companies and the cultural and emotional investments of audiences. It also underscores the importance of transparency and quality in content creation, especially in an era where information is widely accessible and consumer opinions can quickly spread through social media.
