It seems like there might be some confusion or misinformation in your statement regarding Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rates. In Poland, the standard corporate income tax rate is indeed higher than what you mentioned; it has been set at 19% for most companies since January 2023. Prior to that, it was 9% for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with annual revenues not exceeding PLN 2 million, while larger companies paid a rate of 19%.

The points you raised about the challenges faced by Polish entrepreneurs are significant and worth discussing:

1. **Entrepreneurial Will and Market Sentiment**:
   - Poles indeed have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, as evidenced by high levels of belief in the value of running one's own business. However, the sentiment has been affected negatively over recent years, which could be due to various factors including economic conditions, regulatory environment, and media influence.

2. **Regulatory Environment**:
   - Poland ranks poorly in terms of ease of doing business, as indicated by the Global Business Complexity Index. High levels of bureaucracy, complex tax regulations, and other administrative hurdles can discourage new businesses from forming and can make it difficult for existing ones to thrive.
   
3. **Media Influence**:
   - The media's portrayal of entrepreneurship has shifted negatively over time, which could contribute to a less supportive public perception of business owners. This shift in sentiment might affect the willingness of individuals to take the risk of starting a new venture.

4. **Economic Factors**:
   - External economic factors such as energy price increases and global market volatility can significantly impact small businesses. These challenges are not unique to Poland but can be exacerbated by the local business environment.

5. **Support Systems**:
   - Countries like Switzerland have robust support systems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including favorable tax policies, access to funding, and a supportive regulatory framework. In contrast, Polish SMEs might face more hurdles in accessing similar resources.

6. **Government Policies**:
   - The government's role in promoting business can be crucial. Switzerland's government actively supports its businesses through various initiatives, whereas the perception in Poland is that the government and regulations are less supportive of local enterprises.

### Addressing the Challenges:

- **Simplify Regulations**: Streamlining bureaucratic processes and simplifying tax laws could make it easier for entrepreneurs to start and run businesses.
- **Promote Positive Media Representation**: Encouraging media outlets to highlight success stories and positive aspects of entrepreneurship can help improve public perception.
- **Increase Support Programs**: Implementing more government programs that provide financial support, training, and resources for new businesses can foster a more supportive environment.
- **Foster Innovation**: Investing in innovation and technology can help Polish businesses remain competitive both domestically and internationally.

By addressing these challenges, Poland could create a more favorable climate for entrepreneurship, which is essential for economic growth and development.
