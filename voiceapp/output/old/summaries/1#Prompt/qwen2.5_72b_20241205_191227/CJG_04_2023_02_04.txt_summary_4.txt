Thank you for sharing that insightful conversation, Maciej Stefaniak. It's clear that the discussion touched on several important economic and social issues. Hereâ€™s a summary of some key points:

1. **Influence of Giants**: The idea that large corporations or "giants" have significant influence over politicians, rulers, and officials was discussed. This influence can shape regulations and policies in ways that benefit these entities.

2. **Credit and Future Faith**: The role of credit in economic behavior was highlighted. Taking long-term loans (20-30 years) often requires a level of faith in the future, believing that one will have the means to pay them off. A decline in loan-taking could indicate a loss of this faith or, as Maciej suggested, a reduction in banks' willingness to lend.

3. **Behavioral Economics**: The conversation also touched on the idea that people's economic behavior doesn't necessarily improve over time due to learning. Instead, external factors like bank policies can significantly impact whether loans are taken out. This was compared to an alcoholic who stops drinking not because they've become smarter but because they can no longer access alcohol.

4. **Societal Wisdom**: The goal of the "Foundation for more wisdom" is to promote smarter decision-making in society. This aligns with the idea that better economic knowledge and understanding can lead to more informed and beneficial choices.

5. **Future Discussions**: You mentioned an invitation for a follow-up conversation, which suggests ongoing engagement on these topics.
