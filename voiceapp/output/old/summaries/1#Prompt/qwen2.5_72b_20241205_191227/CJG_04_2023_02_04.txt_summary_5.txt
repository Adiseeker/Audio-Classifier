Thank you for sharing that detailed discussion. The points raised by Maciej Stefaniak touch on several important economic and societal issues, including the role of credit, public trust in the future, and the influence of large entities on regulatory frameworks.

### Key Points:

1. **Influence of Large Entities:**
   - The statement suggests that while ordinary individuals may not have significant influence over politicians, rulers, and officials, large corporations or "giants" do. This can lead to regulations being designed in ways that benefit these larger entities.
   - This is a common critique in discussions about corporate lobbying and the impact of money on politics.

2. **Credit and Future Faith:**
   - Credit often involves a long-term commitment, which requires a certain level of confidence in future economic stability and personal financial prospects.
   - The observation that people are still willing to take loans if banks offer them suggests that the issue is not a lack of faith or economic understanding among individuals but rather the availability and terms of credit offered by financial institutions.

3. **Behavioral Economics:**
   - The example of an alcoholic who cannot buy vodka because it's not available, despite still wanting it, highlights how external constraints can affect behavior. This ties into broader discussions in behavioral economics about how people make decisions under various conditions.
   - It suggests that peopleâ€™s behaviors are often influenced by the options and incentives presented to them rather than a sudden change in personal wisdom or economic understanding.

4. **Role of Education and Wisdom:**
   - The goal of initiatives like the "Foundation for more wisdom" is to promote better decision-making in society through education and awareness.
   - This aligns with the idea that informed and educated individuals are more likely to make wiser choices, both economically and socially.

### Conclusion:
The conversation underscores the complex interplay between individual behavior, institutional policies, and broader economic conditions. It highlights the importance of understanding these dynamics to foster a more informed and resilient society.
