It seems like you've shared a segment from a discussion or radio program that touches on several topics, including the reception of a certain adaptation of Peter Jackson's work (likely referring to "The Lord of the Rings" and its spin-offs or adaptations), audience reactions, and broader issues about representation in media. The conversation also delves into concerns about ideology influencing casting decisions and the potential impact on the quality of productions.

To break down some key points:

1. **Critical vs. Audience Reception**: The discussion mentions a significant disparity between how critics and audiences rated a new adaptation (presumably "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" series). Critics gave it a relatively high rating, while audience ratings were much lower.

2. **Representation in Media**: There's a concern raised about the inclusion of diverse actors being driven by ideological considerations rather than their acting abilities. This has led to accusations of poor quality and even suggestions that some productions are using these inclusions as a form of propaganda.

3. **Audience Reaction**: The speaker suggests that there is a "rebellion" among fans who feel that ideology is overriding the quality of content, leading to negative reactions and backlash against certain productions.

4. **Cultural Context**: The discussion also touches on broader cultural issues, such as how these changes in media are perceived in an open society and the potential backlash when audiences feel their preferences or standards are being ignored.
