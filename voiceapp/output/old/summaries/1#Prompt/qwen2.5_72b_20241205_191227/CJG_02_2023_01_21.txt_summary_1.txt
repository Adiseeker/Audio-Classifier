It seems like there's a lot to unpack from your detailed discussion of the entertainment industry, its economic impact, and the cultural backlash against certain high-budget productions. Let me break down some key points and provide some context:

### Economic Impact of Cinema Networks
1. **Ticket Distribution Revenue**: In many countries, major cinema networks earn significant revenue not just from ticket sales but also from distribution deals with film studios. This can include a cut of the box office earnings as well as fees for exclusive screenings.
2. **High-Stakes Investments**: The entertainment industry often sees large investments in high-profile productions, hoping to recoup these costs through box office success, merchandising, and streaming rights.

### Breakthrough Year: 2022
1. **Financial Losses**: In 2022, several major film studios experienced significant financial losses, with some losing up to $200 million per movie. This is a stark contrast to previous years where blockbuster films often turned a profit.
2. **Reasons for Losses**:
   - **Pandemic Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic led to theater closures and reduced audience turnout.
   - **Streaming Competition**: The rise of streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ has分流了观众，减少了实体电影院的客流量。
   - **观众期望与实际质量不匹配**：高预算电影未能满足观众的期待，导致负面口碑和票房不佳。

### Case Study: "The Rings of Power"
1. **High Investment**: Amazon invested almost a billion dollars in "The Rings of Power," making it one of the most expensive productions ever.
2. **Mixed Reception**: Despite being marketed as a major success, the series received mixed reviews from critics and fans. The gap between the official marketing and public reception highlighted issues with transparency and genuine audience feedback.

### Media Manipulation
1. **Paid Critics and Rankings**: There are concerns about media companies buying favorable reviews and rankings to manipulate public opinion.
2. **Audience Discontent**: As viewers became aware of these practices, trust in mainstream media and official ratings declined, leading to more critical and independent assessments.

### Local Example: "The Witcher"
1. **Cultural Significance**: "The Witcher" is a significant cultural export from Poland, based on the works of Andrzej Sapkowski.
2. **Fan Backlash**: The adaptation by Netflix faced criticism for deviating from the source material and not respecting the original story. This led to fan protests and even the departure of key cast members.

### Broader Impact
1. **Economic Decline**: The decline in movie theater attendance and the financial losses of major studios have broader economic implications, affecting related industries like advertising, food service, and tourism.
2. **Cultural Shifts**: The entertainment industry's practices are influencing how culture is consumed and perceived, leading to a more skeptical audience and a demand for more authentic and respectful content.

### Future Discussions
1. **Mass Culture and the Economy**: As you mentioned, further discussions on how mass culture impacts the economy and global situations will be important.
2. **Expert Insights**: Inviting experts like Mariusz Stefaniak can provide deeper insights into these complex issues.
