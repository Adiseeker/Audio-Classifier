It seems like there’s a lot to unpack from your detailed narrative about the film industry, particularly focusing on the challenges faced by large productions and the impact of negative audience reception. Let's break it down into key points:

### 1. **Economic Impact of Cinema Distribution**
- **Big Companies and Ticket Sales**: Major corporations earn substantial revenue from distributing cinema tickets. This can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars per movie, highlighting the significant economic role of the film industry.
- **2022 Breakthrough Year**: In 2022, there was a notable shift where some of the largest productions began to incur significant losses instead of profits. For instance, a single movie might lose up to $200 million.

### 2. **Case Study: "The Rings of Power"**
- **Huge Investment**: Amazon and Amazon Studios invested almost a billion dollars into "The Rings of Power," an unprecedented amount in the industry.
- **Mixed Reception**: Despite being marketed as a massive success, the series received harsh criticism from ordinary viewers and independent experts. There was a significant discrepancy between the official media narrative (which praised the series) and the actual audience response.
- **Manipulation of Reviews**: The situation is described as one where Amazon allegedly bought critics and ratings to artificially inflate the show’s popularity, leading to a disconnect between the perceived success and the real audience sentiment.

### 3. **Impact on Audience Perception**
- **Expectations vs. Reality**: Audiences often have high expectations for big-budget productions, especially when they are based on beloved properties like "The Lord of the Rings." When these expectations are not met, it can lead to significant disappointment and backlash.
- **Consumer Reaction**: This pattern has been repeated with other major productions, leading to a general decline in market performance as audiences become more critical and less willing to invest in overhyped projects.

### 4. **Case Study: "The Witcher"**
- **Polish Cultural Impact**: The "Wiedźmin" (The Witcher) series, based on Andrzej Sapkowski's books, is a significant cultural export from Poland. However, the Netflix adaptation faced criticism for not accurately representing the source material and Polish culture.
- **Fan Backlash**: This led to strong reactions from fans, including the departure of the lead actor, Henry Cavill, as a form of protest against what they perceived as a disservice to Sapkowski’s work.

### 5. **Broader Implications**
- **Economic Decline**: The failure of major productions has contributed to a broader economic decline in the film and entertainment industry.
- **Audience Trust**: There is a growing distrust among audiences towards big-budget, highly marketed projects, leading to a more skeptical consumer base.

### 6. **Future Discussions**
- **Mass Culture and Economy**: You mentioned that you will discuss how these changes in mass culture affect the economy and global situation with Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financier. This is a crucial topic as it ties together cultural trends with economic outcomes.

### Conclusion
The film industry's recent struggles highlight the complexities of balancing high expectations, large investments, and audience satisfaction. The cases of "The Rings of Power" and "The Witcher" illustrate how even massive budgets and marketing efforts can fail if they do not resonate with the intended audience. This has broader implications for the entertainment industry and the economy as a whole.
