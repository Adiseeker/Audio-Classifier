Thank you for sharing that insightful discussion, Maciej Stefaniak. The points raised are quite significant in understanding the dynamics of credit, economic behavior, and societal trust.

To summarize and reflect on a few key points:

1. **Influence of Giants**: The idea that large corporations or "giants" have more influence over politicians, rulers, and officials is a common concern in discussions about power and regulation. This often leads to regulations being designed to manage these influences, ensuring they do not unfairly tip the scales against public interest.

2. **Credit and Future Faith**: The willingness to take on long-term credit (like 20-30 year loans) does indeed reflect a level of faith in the future. It suggests an optimism that one will have the means to repay the debt over time. When banks tighten lending standards, it can be seen as a loss of this collective confidence, but it also reflects the banks' assessment of risk and economic conditions.

3. **Behavioral Economics**: The notion that people's behavior doesn't fundamentally change unless external factors (like bank policies) force them to is an interesting one. It suggests that while individuals may not inherently become more financially savvy, they can be influenced by the availability of credit and other financial tools. This ties into the broader discussion of how economic systems shape individual behaviors.

4. **Wisdom in Society**: The goal of fostering more wisdom and smarter decisions in society is a noble one. It involves education, better information dissemination, and creating an environment where individuals can make informed choices. Initiatives like the "Foundation for More Wisdom" aim to contribute to this by promoting financial literacy and critical thinking.

Thank you, Krzysztof Strauchman, for facilitating such a thought-provoking conversation. It's always valuable to explore these topics in depth, especially given their impact on everyday life and economic stability.
