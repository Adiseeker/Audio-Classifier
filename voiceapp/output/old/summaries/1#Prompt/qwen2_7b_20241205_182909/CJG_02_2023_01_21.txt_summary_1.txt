The text discusses issues related to cinema culture specifically with a focus on large-scale productions being more profitable than expected, causing significant losses for some big companies involved. It mentions examples of "Rings of Power" from Tolkien's world and "Sapkowski and Wiedźmin", another popular brand originating from Poland.

It highlights concerns about the quality versus hype discrepancy in movie releases where large amounts are spent on production but fail to live up to expectations. The author also points out potential issues with marketing practices, suggesting that some productions receive positive reviews or accolades because they've been 'bought' by critics and evaluators through financial incentives.

The text further discusses the impact of such practices on both movie industries and audiences. It notes how these failures can lead to a decline in market performance and potentially affect the economy as a whole since cinema ticket distribution is seen as a significant source of revenue for some companies.

The mention of Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financier, suggests that further analysis will delve into this topic in depth during his upcoming discussion on this matter scheduled on Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 AM by "Fundacja Więcej Mądrości". The author invites listeners to join these discussions.
