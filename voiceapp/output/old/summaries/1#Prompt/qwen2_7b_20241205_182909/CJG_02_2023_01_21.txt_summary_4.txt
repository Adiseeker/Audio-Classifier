It seems like this conversation discusses several complex issues related to the film industry, specifically focusing on the dynamics between big companies, their financial investments, marketing strategies, customer expectations, and public criticism. Here are some key points:

1. **Financial Impact**: Major film studios are dealing with significant losses due to the high investment costs in their productions compared to revenues generated from ticket sales. One example mentioned is "Rings of Power", where Amazon spent almost a billion dollars on production but faced substantial losses. This suggests that despite heavy financial investments, they may not always recoup costs through box office returns.

2. **Marketing Strategies**: There's an interesting tactic mentioned where a large company might influence public opinion and media coverage by 'buying' critics and evaluation services to promote their films positively. This could indicate a shift towards more aggressive promotional strategies in the film industry, possibly affecting both production quality perceptions and consumer expectations.

3. **Public Expectations**: The conversation also touches on the discrepancy between audience expectations based on financial investment levels and the actual perceived quality of films. It mentions that when viewers expect 'unprecedented' or 'monumental' content due to significant investment, their disappointment might be intense if the final product doesn't meet those high standards.

4. **Creative Disputes**: There seems to be conflict between large corporations producing movies based on existing franchises (like Tolkien's world) and original creators or rights holders (in this case, Sapkowski and Wiedźmiń). The issue appears to center around the alteration of creative visions and potential disrespect towards source material by these big companies.

5. **Economic Impact**: These issues not only affect individual projects but could also contribute to a broader economic downturn in certain aspects of the film industry. It might lead to changes in business models, production strategies, or even shifts in consumer behavior when it comes to spending on movies.

6. **Upcoming Discussion**: The conversation concludes with an invitation to discuss these issues further in an upcoming meeting involving Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist and financier, suggesting that this topic might have broader economic implications beyond the film industry itself.

This discussion highlights not only financial and creative tensions but also consumer expectations and market dynamics within the entertainment industry, offering a complex picture of how various stakeholders interact and influence each other's strategies and outcomes.
