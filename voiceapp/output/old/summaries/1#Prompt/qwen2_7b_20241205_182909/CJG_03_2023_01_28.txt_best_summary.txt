It seems like Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak was inspired from previous conversations about how TV series and movie productions can impact large companies financially. Specifically, he was looking at the Netflix series "The Ring of Power" that is produced by Amazon Studios and boasts a huge investment cost of $1 billion.

Mr. Stefaniak mentioned that while Amazon Studio tends to be boastful about their successes and numbers in previous series and movies that were cash successes, they are not showcasing how successful "The Ring of Power" has been or may potentially become financially. This is somewhat surprising as typically such high investment amounts would be accompanied by claims of returns.

He noted that in past productions like "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy which won 11 Oscars and earned several times more than their production costs, and "The Hobbit" trilogy earning an average of $250 million per part, one can expect something similar from "The Ring of Power". 

He then discussed why the film industry differs from other industries like steel or car production. The importance lies in not only financial returns but also in how it shapes people's minds and views which influences all their life decisions shaping society itself.

Furthermore, he pointed out that some films like Star Wars were huge successes due to an ideology prevalent throughout them. There was speculation if "The Ring of Power" might follow a similar path because the common denominator for big hits seems to be ideology dominating these productions.

There's a hint of controversy and potential manipulation around this topic since it involves the powers of this world using entertainment effectively as propaganda or power tools rather than just financial returns.

Lastly, he mentioned that they will take a break before concluding their conversation and returning with more analysis on how successful or unsuccessful movies affect companies financially.
