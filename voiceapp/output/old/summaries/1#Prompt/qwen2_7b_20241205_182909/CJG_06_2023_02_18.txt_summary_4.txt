The speaker expresses their concerns about multiple issues affecting Poland's economy, particularly those concerning the use of fossil fuels and the impact on public health as well as the environment. 

They argue that high concentration of suspended dust due to air pollution leads to numerous deaths each year (estimated at 50,000) in Poland. The speaker also criticizes Poland for being Europe's "trash bin", referring to large amounts of illegally imported garbage which results in toxic pollution.

The main concern seems to be the increasing price of coal energy from PLN 300 to PLN 2,000. This rise leads to severe economic impacts affecting children and companies alike. The speaker warns about a potential economic crisis that could result not only in bankruptcy but also mass suicides due to stress and lack of hope.

The speaker calls for more attention towards these issues which he believes are being under-reported by the media. He concludes his speech by inviting everyone involved, including Mr. Mariusz Stefania, President of Foundation "More Wisdom", to further discuss these matters on a radio program scheduled next week.

The tone is urgent and emotional as the speaker stresses about the severity of these problems and their potential consequences. The message emphasizes the need for immediate action rather than ideological or moral reasons which he believes could be addressed by more consistent measures towards cleaner energy sources such as fossil fuels.
