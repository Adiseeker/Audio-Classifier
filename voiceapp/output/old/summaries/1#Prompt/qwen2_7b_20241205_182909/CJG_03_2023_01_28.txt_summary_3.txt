The above text appears to discuss a comparison of the rating levels for two different versions of a movie from Peter Jackson's works, one being seemingly perfect with high ratings from both critics and viewers while the other receiving polarising reviews from the public with some buying into negative reviews and even paying people to watch it. The discussion also touches upon issues involving representation in film, politics influencing selection process and the pressure on studios to fulfill quotas for diversity based on certain demographic percentages.

It then shifts focus onto a specific scenario involving 'black actors', 'homosexuals' or 'people playing homosexuals' in films being perceived as problematic by audiences despite no negative feedback about placing these characters in narratives. The speaker points out the potential influence of politics and ideology in hiring decisions, comparing it to past practices where political commissars influenced managerial decisions.

The conversation concludes with an emphasis on the importance of quality over ideological content or quotas, citing frustration from fans towards "ideological, propaganda, poor-quality videos". 

Lastly, there is a mention about another radio program hosted by Krzysztof Strauchman and featuring Mariusz Stefaniak, president of the "Więcej Mądrości" Foundation. They encourage listeners to tune in to 'Inne Radio' on Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 AM for more discussions.

Overall, this text is likely discussing concerns about diversity quotas affecting quality in media production and audience expectations versus political or ideological pressures shaping these decisions, with a call towards prioritizing content quality over other external influences.
