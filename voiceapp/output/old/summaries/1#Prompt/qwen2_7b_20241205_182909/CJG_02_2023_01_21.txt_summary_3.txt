It seems like you're discussing some significant issues within the entertainment industry related to cinema productions and gaming, particularly pointing out examples of high investments that didn't meet audience expectations. The text also mentions a conflict between large corporations investing huge sums in media products and the opinions of independent experts and viewers who were not satisfied with these works.

The text appears to be structured around a critique against companies using resources (like money for publicity or critics' reviews) to manipulate public perception, arguing that they are buying positive feedback instead of earning it through quality content. The example of Tolkien's "Rings of Power" series mentioned in the Amazon production seems to highlight this point.

The situation described suggests issues with a lack of transparency and authenticity in the industry, with a clear emphasis on financial overperformance rather than audience satisfaction. This might also lead to underestimating the power and influence of online communities, particularly those who are vocal about their disapproval of certain works or practices (such as fans of Sapkowski's Wied≈∫min series).

The conclusion emphasizes the impact these events have had on the market and calls for a more detailed discussion with an economist named Mariusz Stefaniak to explore how mass culture influences economy in the global context. The text closes by inviting listeners to join this conversation which seems to revolve around issues of transparency, audience satisfaction, and economic repercussions.
