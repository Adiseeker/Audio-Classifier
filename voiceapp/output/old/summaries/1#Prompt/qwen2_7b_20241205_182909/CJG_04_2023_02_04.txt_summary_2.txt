Your message seems to be discussing how certain individuals or entities, notably large corporations or influential people, may have more power when it comes to influencing politicians, rulers, officials due to their wealth. You're also mentioning the use of credit and loans over extended periods (20-30 years) as a tool that demands faith in future stability and earnings.

You suggest these loans are not necessarily indicative of a lack of faith in the future but could be seen as a rational choice for those who might not understand or learn from financial matters. You use an analogy of an alcoholic who, unable to buy vodka due to scarcity or inability to pay, is still willing to purchase it if it becomes available at some point.

Your discussion implies that increased wisdom and education about finance would lead people to make better decisions when dealing with loans and credit. This could refer to understanding risks associated with financial obligations and making more informed choices based on economic knowledge.

The message concludes by encouraging further discussions or engagements aimed at enhancing public understanding of finances, suggesting platforms like your radio show "Astronarium" as a resource for such information.

In essence, your commentary touches upon themes related to socio-economic power dynamics, financial literacy, and the impact of economic choices on individual and societal stability.
