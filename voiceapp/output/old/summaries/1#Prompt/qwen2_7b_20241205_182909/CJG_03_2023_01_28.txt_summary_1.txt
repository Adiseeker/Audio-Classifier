The passage provided discusses a comparison between the critical and viewer reception of two different versions of Peter Jackson's movies. The first version received exceptionally high ratings from both critics (91%) and viewers (95%). In contrast, the second iteration of his work received much lower ratings; 38% from viewers and 85% from critics.

The text also addresses concerns regarding alleged manipulated reviews or paid promotions for films with certain themes, such as diversity on screen. This issue is likened to political commissars in socialist times who could sway decisions regardless of merit due to ideological alignment. The author mentions that there's criticism when weak actors are cast into movies, often due to their supposed demographic fit rather than their actual acting abilities.

The conversation then pivots toward a discussion on the expectations and desires of audiences for quality content over ideological or political messaging. It is pointed out how some viewers perceive films with predominantly black casts or LGBTQ+ themes negatively if these characters do not align with what they expect from actors.

In essence, this passage highlights the tension between commercial success, audience satisfaction, and creative intentions in film-making - particularly when it involves issues of diversity representation.
