The text you've shared discusses a significant shift in the film industry, particularly focusing on losses incurred by big companies from their investments in large-scale productions, exemplified by Amazon's "Rings of Power". This example shows how an unprecedented amount was spent for one movie, which ended up being a 'total crushing', surprising to viewers and experts alike.

The text also mentions the role played by critics and reviewers who might be influenced or bought off by these companies. It suggests that this isn't uncommon in the industry, which is deeply criticized by some viewers and independent experts. The criticism stems from an expectation that more money spent on production will result in better quality of work. However, when that doesn't happen, it leads to dissatisfaction among audiences.

The text also provides a case study involving Sapkowski's "Wied≈∫min", a popular Polish game series, where the production company allegedly destroyed the original creativity and content from the book. The leading actor even left as protest against this treatment of their own product and source material. 

This issue points to a systemic problem in mass culture and entertainment industry that might affect the economy and society at large. The shift towards focusing on big investments but lacking quality could impact consumer confidence, market performance and potentially influence societal values and interests.

The speaker concludes by suggesting further discussion on these matters including their economic impacts during an upcoming meeting with economist Mariusz Stefaniak. They also invite listeners to join this conversation. 

In essence, the message here is about how investment strategies in certain industries could fail due to mismatches between expectations and outcomes leading to negative repercussions for all stakeholders involved.
