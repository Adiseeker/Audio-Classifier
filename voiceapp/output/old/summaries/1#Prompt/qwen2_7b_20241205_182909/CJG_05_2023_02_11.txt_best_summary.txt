It seems like this text discusses the current state of entrepreneurship in Poland based on data from the main statistical office and various studies conducted by organizations such as CBOS and ESA Business. The content highlights that while there appears to be a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship among Poles, with high levels of support for successful entrepreneurs being recognized, the media coverage has significantly deteriorated over recent years.

The text mentions several statistics supporting this notion:

1. **Entrepreneurial Spirit**: Poles are seen as leaders in entrepreneurship globally, with a high percentage believing that running your own business is a good idea and that people who run businesses successfully should be recognized.
2. **Declining Interest**: Despite this positive attitude, there has been a significant drop in the number of people wanting to start companies over the last few years from 58% in 2016 to just 37% by 2019. Additionally, fewer than half as many Poles (6%) compared to Europeans want to start businesses in the next three years.
3. **Business Environment**: There are also concerns about the complex business rules and bureaucratic barriers that exist in Poland, which hinder business growth.

The text argues that these factors combined with economic pressures such as increased energy costs might be influencing people's decisions on whether or not to start a company. It contrasts this situation with Switzerland, highlighting that due to favorable government policies promoting Swiss companies, it may indeed be easier for businesses to operate there compared to Poland.

In conclusion, the text suggests several reasons why entrepreneurship in Poland might seem less attractive than in wealthier countries like Switzerland:

- **Media Impact**: The negative portrayal of business and entrepreneurs by media.
- **Regulatory Burden**: Complex business regulations that hinder growth and expansion.
- **Economic Environment**: External pressures such as energy price hikes, impacting the economic viability of starting new businesses.

Overall, this discussion points out several challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland and suggests areas where policy reforms or media portrayals could potentially improve the entrepreneurial landscape.
