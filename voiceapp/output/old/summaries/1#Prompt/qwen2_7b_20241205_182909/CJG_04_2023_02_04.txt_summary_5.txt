The text you've provided seems to be discussing financial regulations, economic knowledge, and decision-making wisdom in society. The main points can be summarized as:

1) **Influence on Politicians/Rulers/Officials**: The speaker mentions that "giants" (likely referring to influential individuals or organizations like big businesses or financiers) are able to impact policies due to their financial contributions. It's implied that the regulations around financing politicians and rulers reflect this influence.

2) **Long-term Credit and Faith in Future**: The discussion touches on credit taken over 20-30 years, suggesting an element of long-term planning. However, the speaker questions whether taking these loans indicates a loss of faith in the future or simply reflects the lack of alternatives for those who might not understand economic complexities.

3) **Insufficient Credit Availability**: There's criticism of banks' decisions to restrict credit availability, implying this could potentially lead to people being more cautious with their financial decisions and developing 'wisdom'. The speaker likens it to an alcoholic being unable to buy vodka due to restrictions on purchase rather than a lack of interest.

4) **Role in Society**: Lastly, the text ends by encouraging societal wisdom for making smarter decisions. It's likely aimed at discussing how education and awareness might help individuals make better financial choices.

The message seems to be about recognizing and addressing economic complexities that influence peopleâ€™s decision-making processes as well as advocating for policies that could aid societal understanding and smart financial management.
