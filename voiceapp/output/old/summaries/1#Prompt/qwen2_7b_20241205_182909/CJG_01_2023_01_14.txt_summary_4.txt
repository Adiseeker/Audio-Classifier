The text you've provided is a script for an audiobook or radio show discussing various aspects of business, finance, politics, and economics from the perspective of an economist and financial expert named Mariusz Stefaniak. The speaker acknowledges that many people don't have comprehensive knowledge on certain global issues which fundamentally change our world view due to their complexity.

The main points brought up include:

1. **The influence of proximity**: The author discusses how being close to authorities, especially those in politics, can significantly change one's perspective, and most of these individuals are better known through television than personal interaction.

2. **Professional connection**: The speaker mentions that his professional life heavily revolves around business, finance, and politics. However, he regrets this because the experience has led him to see political decisions very differently due to gaining a deeper understanding of economic knowledge.

3. **"If you want to reach the truth, follow the path of money"**: This is an old Latin phrase that indicates how financial interests can influence decision-making processes.

4. **Reviewing gains and losses**: The speaker reflects on the changes in personal assets like Bitcoin investments and property during times marked by crises such as war and rising fuel prices.

5. **The goal of discussion**: The aim of the show is to discuss topics that aren't fully understood by the audience, often hidden aspects which might be related to economic policies or financial strategies.

6. **Acknowledgment of complexity**: Mariusz Stefaniak is thanked for his insights on these complex issues. He's described as an economist and financial expert who provides valuable information.

7. **Concluding thoughts**: The show will continue airing weekly, with Mr. Krzysztof Strauchman conducting future episodes on the radio station Inne Radio in Głuchołazy with the frequency of 105.2 MHz. An additional note is given that interested listeners can also visit their YouTube channel for more information.
