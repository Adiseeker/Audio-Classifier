It seems like we're discussing about the impact of major companies on various industries, specifically focusing on cinema and gaming industry, and how these big corporations' decisions can affect their financial status. 

You mentioned that in a year as significant as 2022, some of the biggest film studios saw substantial losses from one movie production reaching up to $200 million. This is largely attributed to certain releases like "Rings of Power", which was produced by Amazon Studios and cost almost a billion dollars — an unprecedented amount in Hollywood.

The problem appears to be twofold:

1) There's a disconnect between the corporation's perception of success (as reflected by media coverage and declarations of 'incredible' successes) vs. audience feedback, which is often more critical or under-represented.
2) Major corporations have been accused of paying for positive reviews or influencing criticism in favor of their projects.

It was also mentioned that these incidents led to debates among experts who disagreed with the corporation's narrative about success and often faced challenges in getting their voices heard due to lack of platform in mainstream media. This highlights issues of power dynamics within the industry.

You then went on to discuss how this can affect consumer perception when they feel misled by hype or when they compare new products to older ones, expecting improvements that do not materialize. This dissatisfaction could translate into loss of interest and sales over time, which was seen as a major factor affecting the market in your current situation.

Lastly, you referenced another case study involving Sapkowski's "Wiedźmiń" series being transformed into a TV series by an international corporation, resulting in criticism from fans who felt their beloved IP had been mishandled or degraded. This was also paralleled to the gaming industry and how such actions could impact Polish culture.

You ended with inviting further discussion on these topics with Mariusz Stefaniak in future meetings and mentioned your platforms for broadcasting this information.

In summary, it appears that you're dealing with complex issues surrounding corporate influence over creative industries, public perception, media bias, consumer expectations, and their overall economic implications. These are significant concerns worthy of deeper exploration and discussion.
