### Key Themes:
1. **Economic Concerns**: The deterioration of the Polish economy due to fossil fuel dependency.
2. **Environmental Degradation**: High pollution levels caused by burning fossil fuels, both domestically and internationally, including the issue of being a "trashcan" for Europe.
3. **Health Risks**: The impact of pollution on public health, such as respiratory diseases.
4. **Global Pollution Responsibility**: China and the USA's significant contributions to global pollution.

### Impacts:
1. **Economic**: Increased costs due to dependence on expensive energy sources from abroad, potentially leading to economic collapse.
2. **Technological**: The lack of control over energy sources suggests a need for technological innovation in sustainable alternatives.
3. **Political**: The geopolitical relationships and the role of China in global pollution.
4. **Social**: Health crises, mass suicides due to economic distress, and mental health issues such as depression.

### Examples and Evidence:
1. The rise in coal prices from PLN 300 to PLN 2,000 indicates potential economic disaster.
2. Pollutant emissions related to air quality have resulted in 50,000 deaths annually in Poland.
3. Illegal dumping of garbage in Poland has caused significant pollution issues.

### Opportunities and Risks:
1. **Opportunities**: Transitioning to renewable energy sources can stimulate the economy and reduce health risks.
2. **Risks**: The shift may face opposition from industries reliant on fossil fuels, leading to job losses and economic instability in the short term.

### Conclusion:
The text highlights critical issues surrounding Poland's reliance on fossil fuels, pollution, and its implications for the economy and public health. It suggests that while there are ideological reasons for avoiding certain actions (like cutting off China), the immediate risks of environmental degradation and economic collapse are too great to ignore. The need for sustainable alternatives and international cooperation is emphasized, with a call for more consistent action towards global pollution reduction. The text also raises concerns about the mental health consequences of economic distress and suggests that addressing these issues should be a priority.
