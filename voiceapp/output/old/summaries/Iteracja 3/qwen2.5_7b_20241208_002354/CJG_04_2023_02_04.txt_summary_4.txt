2. **Credit and Economic Behavior**: It explores the relationship between credit availability, economic behavior, and confidence in future prospects.
3. **Economic Knowledge and Decision-Making**: There is a critique of individuals' and organizations' economic decision-making processes.

### Impacts

### Examples and Evidence

- **Credit Availability**: The discussion around credit availability and people's willingness to take loans underscores the importance of economic confidence. It also highlights how banks' lending practices can shape consumer behavior.

### Opportunities and Risks
