**Key Themes:**

1. The Polish real estate market is experiencing a crisis due to a lack of demand for housing loans, leading to a decrease in loan amounts and potentially lower housing prices.
2. The COVID-19 pandemic and the influx of Ukrainian refugees have disrupted the market, causing prices to drop despite initial expectations of a price surge.

**Impacts:**

1. Economic: The crisis is affecting development companies, which are struggling to find buyers for their new constructions.
2. Technological: The shift in demand is also influencing the rental market, with average rent increasing and prices falling.
3. Political: The government's response to the crisis, including imposing additional fees on bulk buyers, may not effectively address the underlying issues.
4. Social: The market downturn is impacting potential homebuyers, who are facing a decrease in affordable housing options.

**Examples and Evidence:**

1. The data from the Office of Credit Information shows that loan amounts have fallen to 30% of what they were last year.
2. The rent rate has decreased after 10 months of continuous increases, according to reports by Expandera and Rentier.io.
3. The average rent of an apartment investment has increased to 5.54 net, equivalent to a flat with a 6.84% interest rate.

**Opportunities and Risks:**

1. Opportunities: The crisis presents an opportunity for the government to address the underlying issues in the market, such as unequal distribution of wealth.
2. Risks: The potential negative impact on development companies and the lack of effective policy responses to the crisis.

**Conclusion:**

The Polish real estate market is experiencing a structural crisis due to a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the influx of Ukrainian refugees. While prices may continue to drop, it is essential for the government to address the underlying issues and implement policies that promote affordable housing options and reduce inequality in the market. Future considerations should focus on finding effective solutions to support development companies and ensure that the market operates fairly and sustainably.
