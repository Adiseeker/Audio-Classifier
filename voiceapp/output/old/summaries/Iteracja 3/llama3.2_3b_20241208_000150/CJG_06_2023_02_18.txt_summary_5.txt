**Summary**

The provided text is a transcript of an interview with Mariusz Stefania, President of the Foundation "More Wisdom", discussing various issues related to Poland's economy, environment, and foreign policy. The main themes can be summarized as follows:

1. **Poland's Economic Development**: Mariusz expresses concerns about Poland's economic development, citing the high cost of energy, particularly fossil fuels, which he believes hinders growth and makes the country vulnerable to external pressures.
2. **Environmental Degradation**: He highlights the issue of air pollution in Poland, attributing it to the importation of illegal garbage from other countries, including China. This has devastating effects on public health, with estimates suggesting that 50,000 people die annually due to dust-related diseases.
3. **Foreign Policy and Global Responsibilities**: Mariusz emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions globally, pointing out that China and the USA are responsible for approximately 90% of global pollution. He criticizes Poland's economic relations with these countries, arguing that they prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability.

**Impacts**

The impacts of these issues can be far-reaching:

* Economic: High energy costs and environmental degradation can lead to economic stagnation, reduced competitiveness, and increased poverty.
* Environmental: Air pollution has severe health consequences, contributing to premature deaths and long-term damage to ecosystems.
* Social: The effects of air pollution can lead to mental health issues, such as depression, and social unrest.

**Examples and Evidence**

Real-world examples and evidence support Mariusz's arguments:

* Poland's reliance on imported fossil fuels makes it vulnerable to global price fluctuations and energy supply disruptions.
* China's massive emissions contribute significantly to global pollution, with severe environmental consequences for neighboring countries.
* The phenomenon of "garbage dumping" in Poland highlights the need for stronger international regulations and cooperation.

**Opportunities and Risks**

Potential opportunities and risks arise from these issues:

* Opportunities:
	+ Investing in renewable energy sources could reduce dependence on fossil fuels and create new economic opportunities.
	+ Strengthening environmental regulations and international cooperation could mitigate global pollution.
* Risks:
	+ Failing to address environmental degradation and reliance on fossil fuels could exacerbate economic stagnation, social unrest, and health crises.

**Conclusion**

Mariusz Stefania's warnings highlight the urgent need for Poland to reassess its priorities and adopt more sustainable practices. By investing in renewable energy, strengthening environmental regulations, and promoting international cooperation, Poland can mitigate the risks associated with fossil fuel dependence and pollution. Ultimately, this will require a fundamental shift in how we approach economic development and our responsibilities as global citizens.
