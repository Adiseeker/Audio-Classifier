**Key Themes:**

1. Environmental degradation: The speaker highlights the devastating impact of fossil fuels on Poland's economy, health, and environment.
2. Economic instability: The speaker criticizes Poland's reliance on cheap energy sources from abroad, which makes the country vulnerable to external factors and economic instability.
3. Social issues: The speaker touches on the rising number of cases of depression, mass suicides, and starvation in Poland, which are linked to the economic crisis.

**Impacts:**

1. Economic dimension: Poland's reliance on cheap energy sources from abroad makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices, threatening its economy.
2. Environmental impact: Fossil fuel exploitation has severe environmental consequences, including air pollution, health problems, and devastating effects on the natural world.
3. Social dimension: The economic crisis is taking a toll on mental health, leading to increased cases of depression, mass suicides, and starvation.

**Examples and Evidence:**

2. Air pollution causing diseases, including high concentrations of suspended dust
3. China and the USA being the biggest polluters in the world, responsible for 90% of global pollution

**Opportunities and Risks:**
