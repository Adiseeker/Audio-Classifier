3. **Energy Policies**: The text criticizes policies that aim to make energy more expensive, particularly by importing it from abroad.
4. **Global Inequality in Environmental Responsibility**: The double standard where developed countries impose environmental restrictions while benefiting economically from less regulated regions is highlighted.
5. **Health Implications**: Highlighted is the significant number of deaths attributed to air pollution, as well as broader health issues such as depression and suicide rates.

### Impacts

#### Economic
- **Energy Costs**: Policies that increase energy costs can lead to inflation, making goods and services more expensive.
- **Economic Growth**: High energy prices can stifle economic growth, affecting GDP and job creation.

#### Technological
- **Innovation Stagnation**: High energy costs might hinder technological advancements that require significant energy inputs.

#### Political
- **Policy Backlash**: Stringent environmental policies could face political backlash if they are seen as harmful to the economy.
- **Global Relations**: The text suggests that Polandâ€™s relationship with other countries, particularly in terms of economic and environmental regulations, is complex and sometimes hypocritical.

#### Social
- **Health Crisis**: High levels of air pollution can lead to severe health issues and increased mortality rates.
- **Mental Health**: The economic strain could exacerbate mental health problems, leading to increased suicide rates.

### Examples and Evidence

- **Energy Prices**: Mention of coal prices jumping from PLN 300 to PLN 2,000 illustrates the rapid increase in energy costs.
- **Health Statistics**: The estimate that 50,000 deaths per year in Poland are attributable to air pollution underscores the severity of the health crisis.
- **Global Pollution Leaders**: Reference to China and the USA being responsible for about 90% of global pollution supports the argument of unequal environmental responsibility among nations.

### Opportunities and Risks

#### Opportunities
- **Innovation in Clean Energy**: Increasing energy costs could stimulate investment in renewable energy sources, leading to technological advancements.
- **Improved Health Outcomes**: Reducing air pollution could have substantial health benefits, improving the quality of life for citizens.

#### Risks
- **Economic Crisis**: Dramatic increases in energy costs can push the economy into a crisis, leading to business failures and job losses.
- **Social Unrest**: Economic hardships exacerbated by high energy prices could lead to social unrest and political instability.

### Conclusion

The text presents a compelling argument for balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, highlighting the potential consequences of neglecting either factor. It calls for a more nuanced approach to energy policies that considers both immediate economic impacts and long-term health outcomes.
