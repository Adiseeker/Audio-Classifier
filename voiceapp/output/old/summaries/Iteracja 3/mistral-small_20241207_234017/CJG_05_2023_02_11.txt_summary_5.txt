#### 5. Conclusion
The text highlights a critical situation where economic regulations, political decisions, and ineffective sanctions are leading to significant hardships for both businesses and consumers. Future considerations should include revising energy policies to encourage domestic production and potentially reevaluating the effectiveness of current sanctions on Russia. There is an urgent need for action to prevent further economic downturn and social unrest due to the rising cost of living.
