"which do not meet this criterion due to their multi-word nature.

Part #3: Separate the tags with commas without spaces.
Usage: The output format is exactly as stated in the guidelines - a comma-separated list of words. This meets the criteria because it provides clear separation between each tag and maintains adherence to the formatting rules for the provided example input text. Other formats like using semicolons or no separators would not meet this criterion due to lack of clarity and distinction between tags.",0.1397,0.0021568453295926363,0.26598465473145777,0.055729314756895076,0.13412901392441035,-0.3057856261730194
