### Impacts
The broader impacts identified include:
1. **Economic**: The concentration of power among a few entities can lead to reduced competition, potentially stifling innovation and leading to monopolistic practices.
2. **Technological**: With such significant control over listed companies, these entities could influence technological advancements and investments, shaping the direction of future technologies.
3. **Political**: The text suggests that there might be a lack of transparency in who is behind these entities and their political influence, which could lead to undemocratic decision-making processes.

1. **Anheuser-Busch**: A large company like Anheuser-Busch is mentioned to be controlled by the "Great Three," illustrating the scale of their influence.

### Opportunities and Risks
