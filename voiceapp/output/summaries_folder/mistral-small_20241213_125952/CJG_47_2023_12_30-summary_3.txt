In the coming year, efforts should focus on increasing political competence and continuing to foster the entrepreneurial spirit that Poland is known for. Policymakers must be cautious not to over-regulate, allowing businesses to thrive in a more permissive environment. Finally, initiatives aimed at raising economic awareness should be expanded to ensure entrepreneurs are well-equipped to navigate future challenges.
