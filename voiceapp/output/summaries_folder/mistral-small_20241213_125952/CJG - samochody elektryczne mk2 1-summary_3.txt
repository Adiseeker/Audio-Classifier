 ### Key Themes

1. **Regulation of Combustion Cars**: The text discusses the European Parliament's directive to ban the sale and purchase of combustion cars by 2035.
2. **Environmental Impact of Electric Cars**: It explores the ecological claims about electric cars, arguing that they are not as environmentally friendly as often portrayed.
3. **Economic and Technological Challenges**: The author highlights the economic burdens and technological barriers associated with electric car production and maintenance.
4. **Monopoly Concerns**: It raises concerns about potential monopolies in the industry due to the need for rare metals in battery production.

### Impacts

1. **Economic Dimension**: The shift to electric cars will significantly increase the cost of car maintenance, as they require specialized equipment and technicians. This could lead to a decrease in overall affordability, particularly affecting lower-income individuals who rely on repairing their own vehicles.
2. **Technological Dimension**: Electric cars require advanced diagnostic systems and high-voltage equipment for repairs, excluding many mechanics from the process. This increases dependency on specialized technicians and dealerships.
3. **Political Dimension**: The regulatory ban by the European Parliament could face backlash from consumers and industry players who might see it as an infringement on personal choice and market dynamics.
4. **Social Dimension**: The shift might create a digital divide in car ownership, with wealthier individuals being able to afford the higher maintenance costs of electric cars while others are left behind.
5. **Environmental Dimension**: While electric cars do not emit fuel directly, their production process and powering requirements still result in significant carbon emissions. This challenges the narrative that electric cars are entirely eco-friendly.

### Examples and Evidence

1. **Energy Production**: The author compares the emission levels of traditional combustion engines with those involved in the production of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars.
2. **Battery Production**: A report from Swedish scientists is cited, showing that the production of batteries for cars like the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S results in substantial carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to years of driving a combustion car.
3. **Rare Metals**: The necessity of rare metals for battery production raises concerns about monopolies controlling the supply chain, echoing historical patterns in other industries reliant on scarce resources.

### Opportunities and Risks

1. **Opportunities**:
   - **Innovation in Battery Technology**: Advancements in battery production could reduce carbon emissions and decrease dependency on rare metals.
   - **Expansion of Repair Services**: Investment in training programs for mechanics to handle electric car repairs could mitigate some of the exclusion issues.
2. **Risks**:
   - **Economic Burden**: High maintenance costs could price out many consumers from the market, leading to social disparities.
   - **Monopolistic Control**: The concentration of rare metal production in a few hands could lead to price gouging and market manipulation.
   - **Environmental Concerns**: The current environmental impact of electric car production challenges the eco-friendly narrative often associated with them.

### Conclusion

The shift towards electric cars, while driven by laudable environmental goals, presents substantial economic, technological, and social challenges. Addressing these issues will require a multifaceted approach that includes innovation in battery technology, investment in training for mechanics, and policies to mitigate the risk of monopolies.
