1. **Key Themes**:
   - Declining entrepreneurship in Poland: A significant number of Poles are suspending their companies and not opening new ones at previous rates, indicating a slowdown in market activity.
   - Media impact on entrepreneurial perception: Positive media coverage of entrepreneurs has decreased, which could affect the public's enthusiasm for starting businesses.
