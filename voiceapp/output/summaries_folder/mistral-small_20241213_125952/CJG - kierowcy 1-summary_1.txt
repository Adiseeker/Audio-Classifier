 **Key Themes:**
1. **Economic Illiteracy**: The text highlights the lack of understanding about how the economy works among certain groups, such as carriers and miners. This prevents them from asking pertinent questions during elections.
2. **Political Manipulation**: Politicians exploit this economic illiteracy by promising unrealistic solutions that resonate with voters but have no practical benefit.
3. **Consequences of Ignorance**: The author argues that the inevitable result is financial ruin for companies and, ultimately, a wake-up call for society to question what's wrong in their country.
4. **Self-Reflection**: The text emphasizes that the problem lies within society itself rather than external entities like the EU government or Polish government.

**Impacts:**
1. **Economic**: Companies may go bankrupt due to poor economic policies, leading to job losses and financial instability.
2. **Political**: Politicians can rise to power by making empty promises, leading to mistrust in the political system.
3. **Social**: There is a risk of societal division if people blame external entities rather than reflecting on their role in the situation.
4. **Technological**: No direct technological impact is mentioned, but economic instability could hinder technological advancements and investments.

**Examples and Evidence:**
- The author mentions carriers and miners as examples of groups lacking economic understanding, which aligns with common observations about the financial literacy gap in various societies.
- The text refers to Poland's experience within a Union (likely the EU), suggesting that similar scenarios have played out in other countries where citizens were unaware of the economic realities behind political decisions.

**Opportunities and Risks:**
1. **Opportunities**: The crisis could serve as an opportunity for people to reflect on their role in society and demand better economic policies.
2. **Risks**: Continued economic illiteracy poses a significant risk, leading to further financial crises and political manipulation.

**Conclusion:**
The text suggests that the root of many societal problems lies in economic ignorance and the manipulative use of politics. To mitigate these issues, there is a need for increased financial literacy among the population. This could involve education programs, public awareness campaigns, and more transparent political discourse focused on practical economic solutions rather than empty promises.

**Future Considerations:**
1. **Education**: Implementing widespread financial education to empower citizens with economic knowledge.
2. **Transparency**: Encouraging politicians to provide clear, actionable economic plans during elections.
3. **Critical Thinking**: Promoting a culture of critical thinking and self-reflection within society.
