While credit holidays might offer temporary relief, they can also encourage irresponsible financial behavior. To support sustainable growth, people should be educated about using credit strategically to increase capital efficiency. Governments should avoid populist measures that only delay economic issues, instead focusing on long-term solutions and promoting public awareness of financial best practices. Future considerations should include enhancing financial education programs and encouraging more responsible borrowing habits among the population.
