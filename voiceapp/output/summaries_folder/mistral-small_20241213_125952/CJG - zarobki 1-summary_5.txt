### **5. Conclusion**
The text underscores the critical need for addressing systemic issues within trade unions to ensure genuine worker representation and fair treatment. Future considerations should include:

By taking these steps, societies can work towards eliminating pathological systems and ensuring that workers receive the benefits they deserve.
