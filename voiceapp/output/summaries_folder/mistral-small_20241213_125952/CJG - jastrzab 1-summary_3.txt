Understanding the unique role and function of central banks is crucial for assessing their performance. The example of Silicon Valley Bank and similar instances underscore the need for robust risk management strategies in financial institutions. Moving forward, it would be prudent to enhance transparency, implement stricter oversight mechanisms, and consider innovative approaches to mitigate potential financial crises.
