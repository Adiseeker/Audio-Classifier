 ### Summary

#### Key Themes:
1. **Phase-out of Combustion Cars**: The European Parliament has approved a directive that will ban the sale of new combustion engine cars by 2035. This decision aims to promote a cleaner and more ecological world.
2. **Ecological Impact of Electric Cars**: The assumption that electric cars are ecologically friendly is challenged, focusing on the production processes and environmental consequences.
3. **Repair and Maintenance Issues**: Electric cars are more difficult and dangerous to repair due to their high-voltage components and the need for specialized equipment. This excludes many people from maintaining their vehicles cost-effectively.
4. **Economic Consequences**: The production of electric car batteries, which require rare metals, may lead to monopolies controlled by a few entities, posing financial risks to customers and suppliers.

#### Impacts:
1. **Economic Dimensions**:
   - **Monopolistic Control**: The dependency on rare metals for battery production could lead to monopolistic control by a few entities, driving up costs for consumers.
2. **Technological Dimensions**:
   - **Maintenance Complexity**: Electric cars require specialized equipment and knowledge, making repairs more complicated and expensive compared to combustion engine cars.
3. **Political Dimensions**:
   - **Regulatory Changes**: The ban on combustion cars will necessitate significant adjustments in manufacturing, infrastructure, and consumer behavior across EU countries.
4. **Social Dimensions**:
   - **Accessibility and Inclusion**: The higher maintenance costs of electric cars may exclude lower-income individuals who rely on affordable car repair options.

#### Examples and Evidence:
1. **Battery Production Emissions**: Swedish scientists have shown that the production of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars emits substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, with each kWh of battery capacity contributing to 150-200 kg of emissions.
2. **Repair Complexity**: Electric car repairs often require high-voltage equipment and specialized knowledge, making DIY repairs impractical and dangerous.
3. **Rare Metal Dependency**: The production of electric car batteries necessitates large amounts of rare metals, which are controlled by a few entities worldwide, risking monopolistic control.

#### Opportunities and Risks:
1. **Opportunities**:
   - **Innovation in Repair Technology**: There is an opportunity for the development of more accessible and safer repair technologies for electric cars.
   - **Sustainable Battery Production**: Investment in research to reduce emissions associated with battery production could mitigate environmental impacts.
2. **Risks**:
   - **Cost Barriers**: High maintenance costs and the complexity of repairs may make electric cars less accessible to a significant portion of the population.
   - **Environmental Consequences**: Continued reliance on traditional manufacturing processes could exacerbate environmental issues, negating the perceived ecological benefits of electric cars.

#### Conclusion:
The phase-out of combustion engine cars by 2035 presents both challenges and opportunities. While the goal is to create a cleaner environment, the current limitations in battery production and repair technologies pose significant economic and social risks. Addressing these issues will require innovations in battery technology, more inclusive repair solutions, and policies that prevent monopolistic control over critical resources.
