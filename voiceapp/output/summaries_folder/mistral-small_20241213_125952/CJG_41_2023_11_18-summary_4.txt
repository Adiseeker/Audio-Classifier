While big corporations wield significant influence through market manipulation, individual consumers possess the ability to drive change through ethical consumption and collective action. The historical examples underscore the potential for silent majorities to challenge oppressive systems and initiate meaningful reforms.

To align with these insights, future considerations should include:

- **Policy Reforms**: Advocating for regulatory changes that curb market manipulation and promote fair competition.

These actions can help balance the power dynamics between corporations and consumers, fostering a more ethical and stable economic environment.
