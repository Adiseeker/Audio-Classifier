 It seems like there's been a bit of confusion with the provided text. The passage appears to be an outro or closing segment of a radio program, possibly discussing economic topics based on the mention of "Mr. Mariusz Stefaniak, economist, financier." However, the actual content of the discussion is missing, which makes it challenging to summarize according to the given framework.

If you have the full transcript or additional context for the conversation between Mr. Mariusz and Mr. Krzysztof Strauchman, I would be happy to help you summarize it based on that information.
