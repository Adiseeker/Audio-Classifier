### Conclusion

The implications of the increased longevity of women and the need to find suitable roles for them in society are significant. Instead of forcing elderly individuals into professional activities, societies should consider reverting to traditional models where elders serve as advisors and mentors. This approach not only respects their life experience but also leverages it for societal benefit.

Moving forward, it is essential to:
- **Adapt Policies**: Develop policies that accommodate the needs of an aging population, including healthcare and social security.
- **Promote Intergenerational Programs**: Encourage programs that foster intergenerational relationships and knowledge transfer.
- **Raise Awareness**: Increase awareness about the value of elders in society to combat ageism and promote inclusivity.

By doing so, societies can better integrate their elderly population and leverage their wisdom for collective benefit.
