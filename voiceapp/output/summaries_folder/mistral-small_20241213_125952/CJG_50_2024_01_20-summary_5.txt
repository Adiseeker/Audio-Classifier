4. **Patriotism and Economic Nationalism**: The text emphasizes the importance of supporting domestic companies and economy for the sake of national sovereignty and prosperity.

### Impacts

1. **Economic Dimension**: The decline of local food production and increased dependence on foreign corporations can lead to job losses, reduced economic growth, and a weaker domestic market.

2. **Technological Dimension**: There might be a lack of innovation and technological advancement in the agricultural sector if local producers are not supported.

3. **Political Dimension**: The issues discussed could influence political debates and policies regarding economic nationalism, trade regulations, and government support for local industries.

### Examples and Evidence

- **Fertilizer Prices**: The farmers mentioned that they had to cut fertilizer use from 200 kilos per hectare to as low as 100 kilos, indicating significant financial strain.

- **Disappearance of Local Producers**: Many large food producers in Poland have vanished due to unfavorable regulations and market conditions, replaced by international corporations.

### Opportunities and Risks

### Conclusion

The text underscores the critical need for government support and intervention to bolster Poland's local agriculture and food production sectors. By investing in domestic businesses, controlling imports, and fostering innovation, Poland can reduce its economic dependence on foreign corporations, preserve national sovereignty, and improve the quality of life for farmers and their families. Future considerations should include policy reforms that prioritize local producers and create a more balanced and sustainable economy.
