The text draws connections to real-world examples and supporting evidence:
- **Historical Context**: Refers to historical practices of taxation and property rights, emphasizing the idea that taxes were traditionally paid by those who were disadvantaged or "lost."
- **Current Practices**: Mentions the existence of various databases and books documenting buildings and properties, indicating a long-standing practice of data collection that is deemed inefficient.
