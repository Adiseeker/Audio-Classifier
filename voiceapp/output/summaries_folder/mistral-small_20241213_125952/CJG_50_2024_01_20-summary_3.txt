4. **Role of Patriotism in Economics**: It emphasizes the need for patriotism to support domestic businesses and ensure a thriving economy.

#### Impacts:
1. **Economic**: The dominance of international corporations has led to the disappearance of large Polish food producers, affecting the overall economic landscape. This trend reduces local employment opportunities and wealth distribution within Poland.
2. **Technological**: While not explicitly stated, the reliance on foreign entities for essential products could hinder technological advancements tailored to Poland's unique needs.

#### Examples and Evidence:
- **Disappearance of Food Producers**: The text mentions several large food producers in Poland that have gone out of business due to unfavorable regulations and market pressures, likely replaced by international entities.
- **Fertilizer Costs**: Farmers are cutting costs significantly by reducing fertilizer usage, which underscores the financial strain they face. The mention of Ukrainian grain influx suggests that uncontrolled imports can disrupt local markets.
- **Lack of Government Support**: A farmer's statement about lacking government help highlights the absence of necessary support mechanisms for Polish agriculture.

#### Opportunities and Risks:
1. **Opportunities**:
   - **Strengthening Domestic Industry**: Investing in and supporting domestic food producers can lead to economic growth, job creation, and reduced dependency on foreign entities.
   - **Improved Government Support**: Increased government support for farmers could mitigate financial strains and ensure sustainable agricultural practices.

   - **Social Unrest**: The financial strain on farmers could result in social unrest and a decline in living standards for rural communities.
   - **Loss of Sovereignty**: Increased reliance on foreign entities poses risks to Poland's economic sovereignty and decision-making power.

#### Conclusion:
The text underscores the urgent need to address Poland's growing economic dependency on foreign corporations, particularly in key sectors like farming and agriculture. To mitigate these challenges, there is a call for greater government support and an emphasis on patriotism to bolster domestic industries. Future considerations should include policies that protect and promote Polish businesses, ensuring a more balanced and sovereign economy.
