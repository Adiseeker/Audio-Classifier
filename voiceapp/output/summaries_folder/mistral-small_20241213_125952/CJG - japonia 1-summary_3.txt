4. **Cultural Differences**: There is a comparison of living standards and cultural norms between Poland and Japan.

### Impacts
1. **Economic Dimensions**: The text suggests that Japan's economic power does not translate directly into affordable housing for the majority, particularly in urban areas like Tokyo.
2. **Technological Dimensions**: There is an implicit acknowledgement of technological advancements in Japanese living standards, such as modern toilets.
3. **Political Dimensions**: The discussion implies that housing policies significantly affect citizens' quality of life and can vary widely between countries.
4. **Social Dimensions**: Cultural differences are highlighted, with Japan's traditional practices (e.g., removing shoes indoors) contrasting with Polish norms.

### Examples and Evidence
- In Tokyo, a 20-meter apartment costs around PLN 2,000 to rent, making it unaffordable for many.
- Japanese apartments are often small and lack amenities that Poles might consider standard.
- The text mentions traditional Japanese villages being more affordable due to depopulation.
- In Japan, cultural practices like removing shoes indoors are not out of necessity but part of tradition.

### Opportunities and Risks
1. **Opportunities**:
   - For Poles, investing in Japanese rural properties could be lucrative given the low cost and potential future demand.
2. **Risks**:
   - High housing costs in urban areas like Tokyo can lead to social inequality and financial strain for residents.
   - Depopulation in rural Japan poses risks to local economies and infrastructure sustainability.

### Conclusion
The text underscores the complex interplay between economic power, housing affordability, cultural norms, and demographic shifts. It suggests that while Japan boasts a strong economy, this does not ensure affordable housing for all citizens. Additionally, cultural differences significantly shape living conditions and expectations. Future considerations should include policy improvements to bridge urban-rural disparities and promote sustainable housing solutions.
