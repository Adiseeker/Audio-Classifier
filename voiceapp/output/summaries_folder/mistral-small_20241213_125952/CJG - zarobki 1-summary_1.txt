### Impacts

### Opportunities and Risks

1. **Opportunities**:
   - **Transparency**: Increasing transparency in union operations can help to build trust among workers.

### Conclusion

The comparison with international examples, like Jimmy Hoffa's case, serves as a stark reminder that these challenges are not unique to any one country. To mitigate risks and seize opportunities, there is a call for increased transparency, regulation, and worker education. Future considerations should include developing robust mechanisms for accountability within unions and fostering a more equitable balance of power between workers and their representatives.
