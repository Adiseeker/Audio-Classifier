 ### Summary Framework

#### Key Themes
The text discusses the increased longevity of women, particularly those over 80 years old, and explores potential roles for this demographic in society. It highlights the significance of state care, awareness, technology, medicine, and hygiene in extending lifespans. Additionally, it touches on historical social functions such as advisors or coaches and compares these with modern notions of workforce participation.

#### Impacts
1. **Economic**: The increased longevity of women has economic implications for healthcare systems and pension funds. Extended lives mean more years of potential retirement, putting pressure on financial resources.
2. **Technological**: Advances in technology and medicine are identified as key factors contributing to longer lifespans. These technological improvements also shape how older adults interact with society.
3. **Political**: Policies related to elder care, healthcare, and social security are influenced by the growing number of elderly people. Governments need to address the changing demographic landscape.
4. **Social**: The text suggests a shift in societal expectations for older individuals. Traditional roles as advisors or coaches are contrasted with modern ideas of professional activity, highlighting potential tension between these paradigms.

#### Examples and Evidence
- **Increased Longevity**: The statement "Now, in the case of women, even above 80" indicates that women are living longer than previous generations. This is supported by advancements in hygiene, prevention, and medical technology.
- **Historical Roles**: The text refers to historical figures who served as advisors or coaches, emphasizing their valuable social roles despite not engaging in typical professional activities.

#### Opportunities and Risks
1. **Opportunities**:
   - **Knowledge Transfer**: Older individuals can serve as mentors or advisors, transferring their knowledge and experience to younger generations.
   - **Social Cohesion**: Engaging older adults in meaningful roles can enhance social cohesion and intergenerational relations.
2. **Risks**:
   - **Economic Burden**: Supporting a larger elderly population can strain financial resources, particularly healthcare and pension systems.
   - **Workforce Pressure**: Expectations for older adults to engage in professional activities may be unrealistic or counterproductive.

#### Conclusion
The text suggests that the extended lifespans of women should prompt a reevaluation of their societal roles. Rather than forcing them into traditional workforce activities, it advocates for recognizing and valorizing their historical contributions as advisors and coaches. This shift in perspective can help integrate older adults meaningfully into society while respecting their capabilities and limitations. Future considerations might include developing policies that support mentorship programs, intergenerational collaboration, and flexible retirement options that align with the unique strengths of an aging population.
