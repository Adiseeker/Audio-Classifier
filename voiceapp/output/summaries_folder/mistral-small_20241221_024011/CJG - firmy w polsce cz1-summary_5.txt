 ### Key Themes
1. **Entrepreneurial Spirit in Poland**: Poles have a high regard for entrepreneurship, with a significant percentage believing that running one's own business is a good idea and successful entrepreneurs should be recognized.
2. **Declining Entrepreneurial Activity**: Despite the positive attitude towards entrepreneurship, there has been a decline in the number of new companies being started and an increase in the number of entrepreneurs considering closing their businesses.
3. **Media Influence**: The media's portrayal of entrepreneurs has become more negative over time, which could be contributing to the decrease in entrepreneurial activity.
4. **Regulatory Environment**: Poland is ranked high among countries with complex business rules, making it difficult for new businesses to thrive and contribute to the economy.
5. **Economic Trends**: The economic challenges, particularly those related to energy increases over the past few years, have exacerbated these issues.

### Impacts
1. **Economic**: The decrease in new business formations can lead to stagnation or even decline in economic growth and job creation. Mature companies may perform well, but the lack of innovation from new startups could hinder long-term competitiveness.
2. **Technological**: Complex regulatory environments often hamper technological advancements, as startups focused on innovation struggle to navigate bureaucratic hurdles.
3. **Political**: The political environment that allows for complex business rules can discourage foreign investment and hinder Poland's global competitiveness ranking.
4. **Social**: A decrease in entrepreneurial activity can lead to social issues such as unemployment, particularly among younger demographics who may not have access to stable employment opportunities.

### Examples and Evidence

### Opportunities and Risks
