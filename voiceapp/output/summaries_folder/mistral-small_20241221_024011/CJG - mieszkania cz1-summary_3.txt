**2. Impacts:**
- **Economic Dimension**: The decline in housing loans indicates a potential slowdown in the real estate sector, impacting both developers and home buyers.

**5. Conclusion:**
The current situation in Poland's real estate market highlights the complex interplay between financial policies, economic conditions, and societal changes like refugee influx. While immediate challenges include affordability and market stability, long-term solutions must address systemic issues within the economy. Future considerations should involve a comprehensive review of lending practices, inflation management, and potential government interventions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.
