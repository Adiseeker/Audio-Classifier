### Impacts

2. **Cultural Dimension**: The text suggests that Polish culture is enriched and spread globally by its emigrants, but this influence is diminished within Poland due to their absence. It also raises concerns about the cultural compatibility of potential Ukrainian immigrants.

3. **Social Dimension**: The social fabric of Poland is affected by the departure of skilled workers and the potential challenges in integrating Ukrainians, who may face difficulties in adapting to Polish culture.

4. **Political Dimension**: There are political undertones regarding the treatment of Poles in other countries, such as Ukraine, and the refusal of Ukrainian authorities to acknowledge historical wrongs.

### Examples and Evidence

- **Emigration Statistics**: The figure of 21 million Poles living abroad serves as evidence for the significant impact of Polish emigration on global culture and economies.

- **Cultural Treatment in Ukraine**: Specific examples are given, such as the treatment of Polish enclaves in Ukraine and the glorification of controversial figures like Stepan Bandera, to illustrate the lack of respect for Polish culture in some places.

### Opportunities and Risks

1. **Opportunities**:
   - **Repatriation**: The opportunity to bring back Poles living abroad could lead to significant economic and cultural benefits for Poland.
   - **Cultural Exchange**: Engaging with the diaspora can foster a richer cultural exchange and promote Polish traditions globally.

2. **Risks**:
   - **Economic Losses**: Continued emigration of skilled workers poses a risk to Poland's economic growth.
   - **Cultural Dilution**: The integration of immigrants who may not share or respect Polish cultural values could lead to cultural dilution and potential conflicts.
   - **Social Tensions**: Social issues may arise from the presence of immigrants who struggle to assimilate, as indicated by police statistics showing a high number of Ukrainians involved in criminal activities.

### Conclusion

The text highlights the need for Poland to address the challenges posed by the emigration of its skilled workforce and consider the potential impacts of replacing them with immigrants from different cultural backgrounds. It suggests that repatriating Poles living abroad could bring significant economic and cultural benefits. Future actions should include policies aimed at encouraging return migration and fostering better integration practices for any incoming immigrants to ensure they respect and contribute positively to Polish culture and society.
