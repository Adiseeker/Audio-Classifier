While the current system is criticized for being financially strained, alternative solutions present opportunities to alleviate this burden. Future considerations should involve thorough evaluation of legal implications, potential risks, and the creation of support mechanisms to ensure the well-being of all elderly individuals, regardless of their familial situation.
