 Based on the provided text, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or incomplete information as the text doesn't convey a full narrative or discussion suitable for the framework you've suggested. It appears to be an excerpt that mentions individuals (Mariusz Stefaniak and Krzysztof Strauchman) and a radio station frequency (105.2).

However, I can outline how the framework would typically be applied if there were more context or a complete narrative:

### Key Themes
- **Leadership**: The text introduces individuals who seem to be leading or involved in some form of program or initiative.
- **Media and Communication**: There is mention of a radio station, indicating that the text might involve media outreach or communication efforts.

### Impacts
- **Economic**: If Mariusz Stefaniak, an economist, and Krzysztof Strauchman are leading a program, there could be economic impacts such as job creation or local economic development initiatives.
- **Social**: The radio station might play a role in social cohesion by providing news, information, or entertainment to the community of Głuchołazy and surrounding areas.
- **Technological**: If the program involves modern media tools or platforms, it could have technological implications such as increased digital literacy or access to information.

### Examples and Evidence
- Real-world examples would be specific programs or initiatives led by economists and financiers that have successfully used radio broadcasts to educate or inform communities. For instance, community development projects that use media outreach to engage locals and drive social change.

### Opportunities and Risks
- **Opportunities**: Use of the radio station could open up opportunities for public education, local business promotion, and community engagement.
- **Risks**: Potential risks include financial sustainability of the radio station, ensuring unbiased content, and maintaining audience interest over time.

### Conclusion
- **Implications**: The involvement of economists and financiers suggests a strategic approach to community development that leverages media outreach effectively. This can lead to better-informed communities and potential economic growth.
- **Future Considerations**: Continued investment in the radio station's infrastructure, content diversity, and audience engagement strategies would be crucial for maintaining its relevance and impact. Exploring partnerships with local businesses and educational institutions could also enhance its value.
