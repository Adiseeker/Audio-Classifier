 ### Key Themes
1. **Transition to Electric Vehicles**: The text discusses the European Parliament's decision to phase out combustion engine cars by 2035, focusing on the shift towards electric vehicles (EVs).
2. **Ecological Impact of EVs**: It questions the ecological benefits of electric cars, highlighting the emissions associated with battery production and the lifecycle environmental impact.
3. **Regulatory and Economic Concerns**: The text raises concerns about the economic feasibility, repair costs, and potential monopolies in the supply chain for EV components like batteries.

### Impacts
1. **Economic Dimension**:
   - Increased maintenance costs for EVs due to their complexity and the need for specialized tools and knowledge.
   - Potential monopolies in rare metals used for battery production, leading to higher consumer prices and reduced competition.
2. **Technological Dimension**:
   - The shift towards EVs requires significant advancements in battery technology and manufacturing processes.
   - Increased demand for high-voltage equipment and diagnostic systems, which are currently scarce.
3. **Political Dimension**:
   - Regulatory changes aiming to promote a cleaner environment may face opposition due to the perceived false assumptions about EVs' ecological benefits.
4. **Social Dimension**:
   - The shift could exclude many people from repairing their cars independently, increasing reliance on specialized services and potentially raising repair costs.

### Examples and Evidence
- **Battery Production Emissions**: A study by Swedish scientists shows that producing lithium-ion batteries for EVs like the Nissan Leaf or Tesla Model S emits significant amounts of carbon dioxide (5.3 tons and 17.5 tons, respectively).
- **Rare Metals Dependency**: The production of batteries requires large quantities of rare metals, which are controlled by a few entities worldwide, potentially leading to monopolistic practices.

### Opportunities and Risks
**Opportunities**:
- Encourages innovation in battery technology and sustainable energy solutions.
- Potential reduction in air pollution from combustion engine vehicles over the long term.

**Risks**:
- High initial costs of transitioning to EVs, including both purchasing the vehicles and establishing the necessary infrastructure.
- Increased maintenance costs for consumers due to the complexity of EV systems.
- Potential monopolies in the supply chain for critical materials used in battery production.

### Conclusion
The text underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological, economic, and social impacts of transitioning to electric vehicles. While the goal is to create a cleaner environment, the current approach may have unintended consequences such as increased costs and reduced consumer choice. Future considerations should include investing in more sustainable battery production methods, promoting competition in the supply chain for rare metals, and developing accessible repair options for EV owners.
