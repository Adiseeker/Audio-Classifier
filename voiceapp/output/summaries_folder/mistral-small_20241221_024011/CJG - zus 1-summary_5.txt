The broader implications of mismanaged international aid further complicate the situation. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement stringent control mechanisms, enhance technological monitoring capabilities, and foster international cooperation to ensure that public funds are used effectively and transparently. Future considerations should include regular audits, strengthening legal frameworks, and promoting a culture of accountability within public institutions.
