The text presents a grim picture of Poland's housing economy, driven by decades of poor government policy that has enriched a few at the expense of many. The expert predicts a future where Poles may face mass dispossession of their real estate, exacerbating an already dire financial situation. To mitigate these risks, there is a need for immediate and comprehensive reforms aimed at promoting affordability and financial independence. Future considerations should include monitoring government policies to ensure they prioritize the economic well-being of all citizens, not just a privileged few.
