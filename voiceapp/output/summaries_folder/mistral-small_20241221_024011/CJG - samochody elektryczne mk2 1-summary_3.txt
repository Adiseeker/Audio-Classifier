 ### Summary

#### 1. Key Themes
- **Electric Car Ban**: The European Parliament has approved a directive banning the sale of new combustion engine cars by 2035.
- **Environmental Impact**: The assumption is that electric cars are ecological, which is questioned due to their production and energy requirements.
- **Economic and Practical Concerns**: Electric cars are more expensive to maintain and repair, limiting accessibility for many people.
- **Monopoly Risks**: Dependency on rare metals for battery production may lead to monopolies in the electric car industry.

#### 2. Impacts
- **Economic**: The shift to electric cars increases costs for both consumers and producers due to higher maintenance requirements and dependency on rare minerals.
- **Technological**: The need for specialized equipment and knowledge for electric car repairs may exclude many from DIY repairs, increasing reliance on professional services.
- **Political**: Policies banning combustion cars may face resistance if the public perceives them as not being in their best interests or based on false assumptions.
- **Social**: The transition could exacerbate social inequalities due to the higher costs associated with electric vehicles, making them less accessible for lower-income individuals.

#### 3. Examples and Evidence
- **Battery Production**: Swedish scientists reported that producing a lithium-ion battery emits 150-200 kg of CO2 per kWh, which is higher than the emissions from using combustion cars over several years.
- **Rare Metals**: The production of electric car batteries requires significant amounts of rare metals, leading to concerns about availability and potential monopolies in the industry.
- **Maintenance Costs**: Electric cars are more expensive to maintain due to the need for specialized equipment and knowledge, making repairs costlier and less accessible.

#### 4. Opportunities and Risks
- **Opportunities**:
  - Investment in green technologies that can improve battery production efficiency.
  - Development of infrastructure to support electric car maintenance and repair.
  - Promotion of sustainable mining practices for rare metals.
- **Risks**:
  - Potential monopolies in the electric car industry due to the control of rare metal resources.
  - Increased social inequality if the costs of electric vehicles are not mitigated.
  - Resistance from consumers who may feel that policies are based on false assumptions about environmental benefits.

#### 5. Conclusion
The shift towards electric cars, while driven by a desire for a cleaner environment, presents significant challenges in terms of economics, practicality, and social equity. Addressing these issues will require careful consideration of how to balance environmental goals with economic accessibility and technological feasibility. Future considerations should include investing in research to improve battery technology, promoting sustainable practices for rare metal mining, and ensuring that policies do not disproportionately burden lower-income consumers.
