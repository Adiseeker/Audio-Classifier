**Examples and Evidence:**

**Conclusion:**
The text implies that Poland should focus on encouraging skilled Poles living abroad to return, rather than replacing them with Ukrainians. This could potentially enrich Poland's economy and preserve its cultural values. Future considerations should include policies aimed at facilitating the return of Poles living abroad and fostering a sense of national pride and unity among the Polish population.
