Banks' reluctance to lend, driven by broader economic issues rather than just inflation, is exacerbating the crisis. The long-term implications include potential economic slowdowns and social pressures, but also opportunities for those seeking affordable housing.

Future considerations should focus on addressing the underlying market system issues and potentially developing policies to support both lenders and borrowers in this challenging environment.
