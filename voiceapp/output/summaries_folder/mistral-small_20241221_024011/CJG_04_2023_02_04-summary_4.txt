1. **Influence of Powerful Entities**: It highlights the ability of powerful entities (giants) to influence regulations and politicians, underscoring a disparity in power dynamics.
2. **Credit and Economic Faith**: The discussion revolves around long-term credit, which requires faith in future economic stability.
3. **Lack of Economic Knowledge**: There is an emphasis on the lack of financial acumen among ordinary people, who might not be as wise or informed when it comes to economic decisions.
4. **Role of Banks**: The text explores how banks control access to credit, which in turn influences societal behavior and economic decision-making.

2. **Technological**: Though not explicitly mentioned, technological advancements might be leveraged by these powerful entities to maintain their influence.
3. **Political**: The ability of large corporations or wealthy individuals to influence regulations indicates a political system that is susceptible to manipulation.
4. **Social**: The lack of economic knowledge among the general public suggests a societal gap in financial literacy, which can have long-term social implications such as increased debt and reduced financial stability.

### Examples and Evidence
