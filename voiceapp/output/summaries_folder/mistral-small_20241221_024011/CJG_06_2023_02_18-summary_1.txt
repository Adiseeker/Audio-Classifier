**Examples and Evidence:**

- The text mentions that in Poland, due to diseases caused by high concentrations of suspended dust, approximately 50,000 people die each year.
- It highlights the economic strain, citing a substantial increase in coal prices from PLN 300 to PLN 2,000 and its potential consequences on the economy.
- The discrepancy between global polluters (e.g., China) and local economic policies is noted, emphasizing the need for more consistent action against major contributors.
