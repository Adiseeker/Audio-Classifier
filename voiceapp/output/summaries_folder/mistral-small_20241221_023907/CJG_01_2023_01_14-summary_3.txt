 ### Summary according to the framework

#### Key Themes:
1. **Inaccuracy in Expert Forecasts**: The text discusses how many experts, including those from prominent institutions like the National Bank of Poland, were incorrect in their forecasts about significant events such as inflation and market growth (e.g., real estate, cryptocurrency).
2. **External Influences on Experts**: It highlights that pressure and financial interests can impact the predictions of experts, leading to biased or inaccurate forecasts.
3. **Power Dynamics**: The text explores how governments and other powerful entities can control information and influence public opinion, often for their own benefit.
4. **Unpredictability vs. Foreknowledge**: It touches on the dichotomy between events appearing unpredictable to the general public but being known in advance by major players, such as the war in Ukraine.
5. **Economic Impact of Events**: The discussion includes how significant global events like pandemics have a more profound economic and social impact than initially perceived.

#### Impacts:
1. **Economic Dimension**: Inaccurate forecasts can lead to poor decision-making in economic policies, affecting financial stability and growth.
2. **Technological Dimension**: The text implicitly suggests that the technological advancements (e.g., digital media) have both facilitated the spread of information and its control by powerful entities.
3. **Political Dimension**: Governments can manipulate public opinion and information for political gain, influencing global events like wars and pandemics.
4. **Social Dimension**: The control of information and expert predictions can have profound social impacts, including fear and compliance among the public.

#### Examples and Evidence:
1. **Inflation Forecasts**: The incorrect inflation forecast by the president of the National Bank of Poland serves as an example of how expert predictions can be wrong.
2. **Real Estate Market**: The optimistic but inaccurate forecasts about endless growth in the housing market demonstrate how financial interests can bias predictions.
3. **Cryptocurrency Market**: Predictions about Bitcoinâ€™s value reaching extraordinarily high levels illustrate the speculative nature of some markets.
4. **War in Ukraine**: The fact that governments had foreknowledge of Russia's attack on Ukraine but did not publicize it shows how information can be controlled for political purposes.
5. **COVID-19 Pandemic**: The pandemic was perceived as a significant health threat, but its economic and social impacts were more devastating than anticipated.

#### Conclusion:
The text concludes that while global events like pandemics have real health threats, their primary destructive force lies in their economic, financial, and social repercussions. It also underscores the importance of recognizing how information can be manipulated by powerful entities to maintain control over public perception and behavior.
